        <h2><strong>Appreciation letter to company sample Trento thanksgiving eve</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Hanukkah</b> is a post-biblical holiday. This means that both the holiday, as well as the events it commemorates, happened after the books of the Bible were written. There is nothing at all in the Torah about Hanukkah which is one of the reasons that &mdash; unlike Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot &mdash; Hanukkah is considered a minor holiday.  <b>Hanukkah</b> &mdash; also spelled Chanukah or other transliterations from Hebrew &mdash; is Judaism&rsquo;s &ldquo;festival of lights.&rdquo; On eight consecutive nightfalls, Jews gather with family and friends to light one additional candle in the menorah &mdash; a multibranched candelabra.  The last time Hanukkah coincided with Thanksgiving was <b>in</b> <b>2013</b> when it began on the night of <b>Wednesday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>27th</b>. The two will not coincide again until 2070 when Hanukkah will again begin on the 27th of November which, in that year, will be Thanksgiving Day.  Learn how to play this <b>Hanukkah</b> game with our video and written instructions. The traditional blessings and procedures for lighting the <b>Hanukkah</b> candles. Learn everything you need to know to celebrate <b>Hanukkah</b> with My Jewish Learning, the web&#39;s leading pluralistic Jewish discovery site.  <b>Hanukkah</b> (Chanukah), the Jewish eight-day &ldquo;festival of lights&rdquo; is celebrated with a nightly menorah lighting--adding a flame each night--special prayers, dreidel playing, and fried foods. What Does Chanukah Actually Mean? What Is a Dreidel? How Many Candles On a Menorah (Chanukiah)? What Is Gelt?  <b>Hanukkah</b> 2023 begins on the evening of Thursday, December 7 and ends on the evening of Friday, December 15. Often called the Festival of Lights, the holiday is celebrated with the lighting of the...  <b>Hanukkah</b> (Chanukah) is the Jewish eight-day, wintertime &ldquo;festival of lights,&rdquo; celebrated with a nightly menorah lighting, special prayers and fried foods. The Hebrew word Chanukah means &ldquo;dedication,&rdquo; and is thus named because it celebrates the rededication of the Holy Temple (as you&rsquo;ll read below).  A rare quirk of the calendar has created an overlap of Thanksgiving with the start of Hanukkah. The last time it happened <b>was</b> <b>1888</b>, and it won&#39;t happen for more than <b>75,000</b> <b>years</b>.  Chanukah was declared a Jewish national holiday 2178 years ago. Thanksgiving was declared a national American holiday on the last Thursday of every <b>November</b> by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Before then, Thanksgiving was celebrated on different dates in different states, so we won&rsquo;t count those. </p>        <p>Guy fieri thanksgiving side dishes. Liquor store hours delaware county.
