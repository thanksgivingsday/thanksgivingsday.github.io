        <p>During Thanksgiving, at Russian Tea Room, Russian people will propose a menu that promises something for everyone. The menu varies, but it usually includes pelmeni or Russian <b>dumplings</b> <b>soup</b> and chicken Kiev to turkey and stuffing.  At the risk of coming off too American, Russian wives really have to find a balance between their Russian <b>recipes</b> and standard American <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dishes</b>. In this article, I have rounded up 5 popular menus during <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Russia you could try during the celebration. Check them out. 1. Stuffed Turkey Roll.

Visitors to Russia are often surprised at the variety and flavors of Russian <b>food</b>, a cuisine influenced by Russia&#39;<b>s</b> connection to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The most classic Russian <b>recipes</b> are made of veggies and wheat, such as soups, porridges, and stuffed dough.  Spread the slices with the <b>Russian </b>Dressing, about 1 tablespoon on each.
