        <h2><strong>Atlanta things to do thanksgiving 2024 Where to order turkey for thanksgiving in houston</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on <b>Thursday</b>, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  By federal law, Americans have celebrated Thanksgiving on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in November since 1942, but numerous other dates were designated in the past. It is believed that America&rsquo;s first Thanksgiving, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668 ...  To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United States entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing Thanksgiving as the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in November. FDR signed the resolution on December 26, 1941 (National Archives). Today, we continue celebrate Thanksgiving on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in November.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  The United States celebrates Thanksgiving as a national holiday on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in <b>November</b>. In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November 28. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year.  On October 6, 1941, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last <b>Thursday</b> in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b>, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the fourth <b>Thursday</b> in <b>November</b>, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942.  Because Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of November, the date varies from year to year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot; The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.  Thanksgiving is nationally recognized on the fourth Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. But the holiday has moved multiple times throughout its history. </p>        <p>Bojangles thanksgiving fried turkeys. Thanksgiving in a bag. Thanksgiving hashtags copy and paste.
