        <h2><strong>Who is serving thanksgiving dinner in atlanta When was the thanksgiving holiday established as the fourth thursday in november</strong></h2>
        <p>Puerto Rico, a gem in the Caribbean, is renowned for its exceptionally long holiday season, which spans from Thanksgiving Day to <b>mid</b>-<b>January</b>. This extended festive period is more than just...  Through the resulting exchange of cultures, <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rico</b> has adopted that most American of holidays: <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Known as &quot;D&iacute;a de Acci&oacute;n de Gracias&quot; in Spanish, the day symbolizes the start of the holiday season. Celebrations revolve around a big family feast, but of course, there is a local twist on the fare.  The U.S. territories such as <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rico</b> and the Virgin Islands do <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the traditional sense but there are islands that have a <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration for their own special ...  While Thanksgiving <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>officially</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>holiday</b> in Puerto Rico, some locals do celebrate it using traditional recipes passed <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>generations</b> among family members who live across different states within mainland US territories such as Florida &amp; Texas.  Read about <b>Thanksgiving in Puerto </b>Rico in 2024. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November in the United States of America. The tradition dates back to 1621, when the pilgrims gave thanks for their first bountiful harvest in Plymouth Rock.  In <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rico</b>, however, the celebration starts after <b>Thanksgiving</b> and ends in the third week of January, on the last day of the St. Sebastian Street Festival in Old San Juan. Religious holidays [ edit ]  <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rico</b> takes pride in having the longest holiday season in the world. On the Island, la Navidad lasts around 45 days, starting right after <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in November, extending through mid-January, and culminating with the Fiestas de la Calle San Sebasti&aacute;n , also known as la SanSe.  Thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing Day in Puer&shy;to <b>Rico</b> is the per&shy;fect exam&shy;ple of a &ldquo;puer&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;can&shy;ized&rdquo; Amer&shy;i&shy;can hol&shy;i&shy;day. In most cas&shy;es Puer&shy;to Ricans like their turkey oven roast&shy;ed, but that&rsquo;s where the sim&shy;i&shy;lar&shy;i&shy;ty ends. The sea&shy;son&shy;ing is most&shy;ly gar&shy;lic, oregano, salt and pep&shy;per.  During the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday, called D&iacute;a de Acci&oacute;n de Gracias in PR, residents stroll along the beaches soaking up sun and go shopping. The weather is perfect here in November&mdash;temperatures range from the mid-70s to mid-80s. And believe it or not, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rico</b> is also the unofficial kick-off for Christmas Season! </p>        <p><b>Who is serving thanksgiving dinner in atlanta</b>.
