        <h2><strong>Albany or restaurants open on thanksgiving What to put in thanksgiving food basket</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is to always be a part of our prayers. Some of the most remembered passages on the giving of <b>thanks</b> are the following: &quot;Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, NKJV).  The <b>act</b> of <b>thanksgiving</b> is a way of recognizing the faithfulness of God in our lives &ndash; it is a way to consciously take time to humble ourselves before God and each other. And Scripture says those who humble themselves will one day be lifted up by God.  Learn about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, what Thanksgiving means in the Bible, how to get along with your family, and ways you can make this celebration more meaningful.  The reason for <b>thanksgiving</b> is found in the saving acts of God because it is these blessings that deliver believers out of Satan&rsquo;s domain of darkness and into the realm of light and spiritual fruitfulness.  Consider, first, how the Bible often links <b>thanksgiving</b> with joy. Let us come into his presence with <b>thanksgiving</b>; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise! (Psalm 95:2) Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name! (Psalm 97:12)  Honoring <b>God</b> and Community in the True Spirit of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. As Catholics, <b>Thanksgiving</b> offers a profound opportunity to reflect on gratitude and <b>God</b>&#39;s providence. While often associated with turkey dinners and family gatherings, the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is deeply rooted in faith, unity, and the acknowledgment of <b>God</b>&#39;s blessings.  <b>Giving</b> <b>thanks</b> to <b>God</b> for what he has given to us is precious and essential&mdash;and so is trusting him for his ongoing provision in the future. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is beautiful, but it can go bad on us, if we try to give it Faith&rsquo;s job.  In many passages throughout the Old and New Testaments, people openly show gratefulness to <b>God</b>. Whether it&rsquo;s called praise, thanksgiving, or more passionately lauding and exalting, it comes from hearts that are submitted and devoted to the Lord.  &ldquo;Praise the <b>Lord</b>. Give thanks to the Lord for he is good; his love endures forever&rdquo; (Psalm 106:1). &ldquo;Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind&hellip;&rdquo; (Psalm 107:15). God&rsquo;s love is just as strong for us today as it was for those in Scripture. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving day dinner ideas.
