        <h2><strong>What to do in chicago on thanksgiving day Order thanksgiving turkey nashville</strong></h2>
        <p>Canadian Thanksgiving is celebrated <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> earlier than in the USA. Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second Monday in October, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.  Unlike American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Canada&rsquo;s national <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>date</b> took decades to become standardized and annual. In 1957, Canada&rsquo;s parliament set the <b>date</b> as the second Monday in October....  Thanksgiving Day in Canada has been a holiday on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year. Thanksgiving Day in Canada is a time for family and food.  Today Canadian Thanksgiving is held on the second Monday <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  Since 1957, Thanksgiving Day has been a holiday in Canada on the second Monday <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. Canadian Thanksgiving is a chance for people to give thanks for fortunes in the past year, including a good harvest. Below, we will explain what people do on Canadian Thanksgiving, as well as the ways that it differs from U.S. Thanksgiving.  Initially celebrated on various <b>dates</b> from April to November, the <b>date</b> of <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was officially set to the second Monday of October by a proclamation of parliament in 1957. The decision was made to distinguish the celebrations from the solemn observance of Remembrance <b>Day</b> in November.  The date of Canadian Thanksgiving has evolved, settling on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> in <b>October</b> in <b>1957</b>. Regional variations in traditions and dishes add diversity to the celebration, making it a unique and inclusive holiday.  Canadian Thanksgiving is in <b>October</b>&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in Canada on 6 November <b>1879</b>. The date for each of the following years, as well as a unifying theme for which to give thanks (usually concerning the harvest, though anniversaries related to the British monarchy were also common), was determined annually by Parliament. </p>        <p><i>What to do in chicago on thanksgiving day</i>. 2106 thanksgiving.
