        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving stories for 7th grade Turkeys consumed on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>My Mom brought this Cranberry and Brie flatbread over for <b>Thanksgiving</b> this year and it was a huge hit. The tart cranberries with the melty brie are an irresistible combination. You just can&rsquo;t help but go in for another slice. This appetizer is just so easy, pretty, and tasty!  Use your extra <b>Thanksgiving</b> turkey to make these Leftover Turkey and Cranberry Flatbreads. You can even add in leftover stuffing or mashed potatoes.  So when Atoria&rsquo;s reached out to me to do a <b>Thanksgiving</b> leftover post, I knew I wanted to go with something light and refreshing and totally different from the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. This Turkey, Cranberry, and Goat Cheese Flat <b>Bread</b> totally hit the mark!  Cranberry Goat Cheese Flatbread is an appetizer that&#39;s as easy to make as it is impressive to serve. Its a delicious start to your <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal.  This crispy sage &amp; butternut squash <b>flatbread </b>is ideal for sharing at your next fall feast. Short on time? Cut the preparation time by using store-bought pizza dough.  To say that I&#39;m obsessed with these Festive <b>Turkey</b> Flatbreads is an understatement. They&#39;re a really fun and delicious way to use up your leftover <b>turkey</b> and are bursting with festive flavour. Stuffed with leftover <b>turkey</b>, cranberry sauce, and sliced brie, your friends and family will be begging you for the recipe!  Next up, a crispy <b>flatbread </b>with our leftovers from our 2 hour Turkey meal that&rsquo;s simple and delicious enough to even make all year round. Ingredients: -leftover turkey. -leftover green beans with balsamic vinaigrette. -1 large sweet potato. -1/2 cup cranberry sauce (we used our leftover cranberry sauce) -2 tb butter.  Light whole-wheat lavash becomes the perfectly crispy base for your turkey and cranberry sauce leftovers. Sprinkle some crumbled goat cheese over these ingredients and add shredded mozzarella for that wonderfully gooey, cheesy bite you love in a great <b>flatbread</b>.  This <b>flatbread </b>absolutely screams fall with creamy butternut squash puree, crisp Granny Smith apples, hints of cinnamon and maple syrup, and finally the buttery pecans. That&rsquo;s about as much fall as you can fit into one dish! </p>        <p>Dnainfo thanksgiving shooting. Thanksgiving weight jokes. Thanksgiving football scores massachusetts.
