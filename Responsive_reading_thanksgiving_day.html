        <p>While 1 pound per person could feel like too little, and 1 1/2 pounds for each guest might be over-doing it, 1 1/4 pounds of turkey per mouth is the perfect balance. At that rate, feeding a large...  Both fresh and frozen turkeys come in a wide range of <b>sizes</b>, <b>from</b> <b>8</b>&ndash;<b>24</b> <b>pounds</b>. Killeen generally recommends a small-to-medium bird. &ldquo;The perfect size for these birds is 12&ndash;14 pounds,&rdquo; she...  Small <b>Turkeys</b> (8-12 pounds): Ideal for smaller gatherings or families. Regular <b>Turkeys</b> (12-20 pounds): The most commonly purchased size for average-sized families during holidays. Large <b>Turkeys</b> (20 pounds and above): Generally suited for larger gatherings or events. Choosing the Right Size <b>Turkey</b>  Over the past half-century, <b>turkeys</b> have been getting a lot bigger.

The general rule of thumb is to plan <b>for</b> <b>1</b> <b>1/4</b> <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>turkey</b> <b>per</b> <b>guest</b>, which takes into account the bones and other inedible parts of the turkey. That should be plenty especially with everyone&#39;s favorite Thanksgiving side dishes on the dinner table.  As tempting as a 20-pound turkey may look at the store, you really don&rsquo;t need one that large for a six-person gathering. The general rule is 1 <b>to</b> <b>1&frac12;</b> <b>pounds</b> of turkey per person. </p>        <p><a href="./634.html">Surf city thanksgiving showcase</a>.
