        <h2><strong>Us president proclaimed thanksgiving national holiday Thanksgiving table decor 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  Thanksgiving Eve (also known <b>as</b> <b>Blackout</b> <b>Wednesday</b>), the night before Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest nights of the year for bars and clubs as many college students and others return to their hometowns to reunite with friends and family. [139]  The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;<b>Day</b> of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  Thanksgiving is usually celebrated with a family meal. Beginning in the 2010s, a new tradition has emerged to also celebrate Thanksgiving with a meal with friends, as a separate event on a different <b>day</b> or an alternate event on Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>. This is referred to as Friendsgiving. [65]  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> is a day for people in the US to give thanks for what they have. Families and friends get together for a meal, which traditionally includes a roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, vegetables, cranberry sauce, gravy, and pumpkin pie.  Perhaps no other nonsectarian holiday has more tradition. Family, friends, food, and football have come to symbolize <b>Thanksgiving </b>&mdash; a rare celebratory holiday without an established gift-giving component. Instead, the <b>day </b>urges all of us to be grateful for things we do have.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Traditional thanksgiving meal calories.
