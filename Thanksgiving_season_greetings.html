        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving season greetings Clarinda iowa thanksgiving catering</strong></h2>
        <p>Most people know the traditional foods served during <b>Thanksgiving</b> and have at least a vague idea of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but not everyone knows all there is to know about this special day....  In the 19th century, the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday started to take shape. In 1846, Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of a magazine called Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book, campaigned for an annual national...  On the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Pilgrims and the Native Americans consumed freshly killed deer, cornbread, seafood, porridge, and assorted wildfowl, among other foods. However, turkey was not part of the Thanksgiving dinner.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass...  The reason we associate the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> with the 1621 harvest celebration is largely due to Sarah Josepha Hale. The editor of Godey&#39;s Lady&#39;s Book and author of the nursery rhyme &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb,&quot; Hale advocated for a national day of giving thanks in the mid-19th century.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621 marks a pivotal moment in American history, embodying a blend of myth, legend, and historical fact that has intrigued and fascinated generations. This iconic event, often depicted in popular culture as a harmonious feast shared between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe, is shrouded in as much mystery as it is ...  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  <b>Fun</b> fact: The Pilgrims didn&rsquo;t use forks; they ate with knives, spoons, and their hands. So, if you&rsquo;re tempted to sneak a bite of pie before grabbing a fork, you&rsquo;re just honoring history!  Did Florida Host the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>? More than 50 years before the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth, Spanish colonists in Florida feasted with Native Americans in what some call the first... </p>        <p>Origami thanksgiving napkins.
