        <h2><strong>Waffle house open near me What stores are open on labor day toronto</strong></h2>
        <p>The United States <b>holiday </b>of <b>Thanksgiving </b>is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  This <b>year</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on Thursday, Nov. 28.Like always, many Americans will gather with loved ones to count life&#39;s blessings and enjoy a meal together in honor of the annual <b>holiday</b>.. If ...  On October 3, 1863, during the Civil War, Lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving to be celebrated on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>26</b>. The holiday was annually proclaimed by every president thereafter, and the date chosen, with few exceptions, was the last Thursday in November.  Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, <b>November</b> 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of <b>November</b>. [2] . Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Thanksgiving as a national holiday owes its origins to <b>Sarah</b> Josepha <b>Hale</b>, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  President George Washington was the first to issue a proclamation for the holiday in 1789, designating Thursday, <b>November</b> 26 &ldquo;for the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving. &rdquo; This marked the first national celebration of the holiday under the new Constitution.  On <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays. </p>        <p><b>Waffle house open near me</b>. <a href="./79.html">Free printable first thanksgiving timeline bracelet</a>. <a href="./170.html">Stores open on thanksgiving boycott</a>.
