        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving object lessons for adults Thanksgiving is an annual celebration but what is it actually a celebration of</strong></h2>
        <p>On October 3, 1863, during the Civil War, Lincoln proclaimed a national day of <b>thanksgiving</b> to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. The <b>holiday</b> was annually proclaimed by every president thereafter, and the date chosen, with few exceptions, was the last Thursday in November.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, expressing gratitude for a pivotal Union Army victory at Gettysburg, President Abraham Lincoln announces that the nation will celebrate an official Thanksgiving holiday...  Caleb Strong, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, declared the holiday in <b>1813</b>, &quot;for a day of public thanksgiving and prayer&quot; for Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>25</b> of that year. [ 45 ] Madison also declared the holiday twice in 1815; however, neither of these was celebrated in autumn.  President Zachary Taylor said around 1849 that it was up to the states to decide when and whether to declare a <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b>; in that period, such <b>a holiday</b> was often celebrated...  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, President Lincoln issued a proclamation designating &ldquo;the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving.&rdquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s announcement marked the culmination of a multi-decade campaign by Sarah Josepha Hale to make Thanksgiving into a national holiday.  Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, <b>November</b> 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  On October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln <b>declared</b> that the last Thursday in November was to be recognized as a Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Obama White House). In 1870, Congress passed legislation making <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>a holiday</b>, but gave the president discretion to declare the date that the <b>holiday</b> would be celebrated.  On <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1789</b>, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November 26, 1789, as an official holiday of &quot;sincere and humble thanks.&quot; The nation then celebrated its first Thanksgiving under its new Constitution. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving object lessons for adults.
