        <p>Actually, studies show that most adults don&rsquo;t gain as much weight as you might think during the holidays. The average weight gain during this time period is anywhere <b>from</b> <b>0.8</b> <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b>...  The average American <b>gains</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>2</b> <b>pounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b>, and if that gain is gonna come primarily during the holidays, it makes sense to try to avoid it. How to Avoid Gaining Weight on Thanksgiving So back to that exercise issue.  Enjoying <b>Thanksgiving</b> doesn&#39;t mean unavoidable weight <b>gain</b>! Put in some planning time, learn to reframe your attitude towards the Thanksgiving <b>foods</b> <b>themselves</b>, and you&#39;re headed for more Holiday enjoyment and less Holiday overloading. Go easy on the calories the week before.  But avoiding holiday weight <b>gain</b> doesn&#39;t have to be difficult. In fact, small decisions can keep the scale steady. This day-by-day plan has you covered from <b>Thanksgiving</b> eve to New Year&#39;s Eve.  Find out the real truth about holiday weight gain (or lack thereof)! 1. A <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>10</b>-<b>pound</b> weight gain is common. False: According to research, weight gain over the holidays is less than one pound. From Thanksgiving to New Year&rsquo;s Day, holiday celebrations and parties are abundant.  In order to gain a pound on Thanksgiving, you would have to eat a total <b>of</b> <b>5,100</b> <b>calories</b> of turkey and pie. That means you&#39;d have to eat: That&#39;s 5,130 calories! But let&#39;s be realistic here&mdash;chances are you won&#39;t actually come near that total.  On Thanksgiving day, you can try slightly reducing portion sizes ahead of your big meal. It might not seem like much when you do it, but this can really make a huge difference. Simply having a smaller breakfast and lunch that day can conserve anywhere <b>from</b> <b>300</b>-<b>600</b> <b>calories</b>, or even more!  Holiday weight <b>gain </b>is a common concern for <b>many </b>adults. Various seasonal holidays may encourage overeating, sedentary behavior, and consumption of calorie-rich foods. In fact, between mid-November...  For decades, the conventional wisdom has been that most people gain <b>around</b> <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> between that first forkful of Thanksgiving stuffing to the greasy egg breakfast on New Year&rsquo;s Day. </p>        <p><a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/793.html">Turkey replacement for vegans for thanksgiving dinner trader joes</a>.
