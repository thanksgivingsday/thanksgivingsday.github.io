        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving restaurants open san diego Denver restaurants open on thanksgiving day</strong></h2>
        <p>What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth <b>Thursday</b> of November but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  On the second Monday of October, Canadians annually celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but how many of us know what we are celebrating or the history of <b>Canadian Thanksgiving</b>? It is not the same <b>day</b> as the United States <b>Thanksgiving</b> nor does it have the same origins.  Initially celebrated on various dates from April to November, the date of <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was officially set to the second Monday of October by a proclamation of parliament in 1957. The decision was made to distinguish the celebrations from the solemn observance of Remembrance <b>Day</b> in November.  Canadians celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second Monday in October, while <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada? In 2025, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada is Monday, October 13.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of Thanksgiving and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating <b>on</b> <b>October</b> <b>14</b> <b>th</b>. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian Thanksgiving is in <b>October</b>&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  <b>Thanksgiving</b> was first observed as an annual event in Canada on 6 November 1879. The date for each of the following years, as well as a unifying theme for which to give thanks (usually concerning the harvest, though anniversaries related to the British monarchy were also common), was <b>determined</b> annually by Parliament.  Today Canadian Thanksgiving is held on the second <b>Monday</b> of <b>October</b> every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, Thanksgiving in Canada had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> traces its roots to an old European farming custom of banding together to toast a plentiful harvest. After hundreds of years of unofficial celebration, the <b>Canadian</b> Parliament officially recognized the folk practice in 1957. </p>        <p>Plymouth thanksgiving day parade parking.
