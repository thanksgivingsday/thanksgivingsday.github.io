        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner in north san diego county Thanksgiving mishaps</strong></h2>
        <p>From the earliest fall feasts to the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  The <b>first</b> official proclamation of a national <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday didn&rsquo;t come until 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln called for an annual <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration on the final Thursday in ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. The <b>first</b> account is William Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip;  But before we all descend into food comas, it&#39;s important to reflect on the real <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> &mdash; and the <b>first</b> one wasn&#39;t all peace, love and pass the gravy. While the settlers at ...  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was held in 1621. Or was it? An expert weighs in on the <b>origin</b>, <b>history</b> and facts behind <b>Thanksgiving</b>, America&#39;s most beloved holiday.  The pilgrims had their <b>first</b> successful corn harvest in the November of that year. To express their gratitude, the Pilgrim Governor William Bradford organized a feast between the Pilgrims and the Native American Wampanoag people, an event that is widely recognized as the <b>first</b> (or one of the <b>first</b>) <b>Thanksgiving</b> feasts in US <b>history</b>.  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  In the 16th and 17th centuries, <b>Thanksgiving</b> days were called following significant events such as drought and floods, as well as the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. 7. Turkey at <b>Thanksgiving</b> came much later. Though <b>Thanksgiving</b> is commonly associated with eating turkey, no turkey was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration in Plymouth. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving weekend activities toronto.
