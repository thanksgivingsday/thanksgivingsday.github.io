        <p>While turkey was likely present at the first Thanksgiving, it wasn&rsquo;t the centerpiece of the meal like it is today. That happened in the <b>late</b> <b>1800s</b>, around the time when President Lincoln made...  How did the <b>turkey</b> become a popular <b>Thanksgiving</b> centerpiece? Did the Pilgrims eat <b>turkey</b>? What about pumpkin pie? See how foods differed from today&mdash;and some historically inspired recipes, too!  A big, roast <b>turkey</b> is always the centerpiece of our <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. And, back in 1621, wild turkeys were also likely part of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but there were also other main dishes, like deer, duck, and goose.  Thanks to letters and records kept by early American settlers, we know that when the colonists sat down to dine with the Wampanoag Indians, beef and fowl were on the menu. This historical meal would later become known as the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  In 1789, George Washington issued a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Proclamation asking all citizens to give thanks together as a country on November 26. It may be because of this first official celebration and a remark supposedly made by Alexander Hamilton that <b>turkey</b> is the traditional food for <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Historians now believe turkey wasn&rsquo;t actually consumed during what was often cited as the first Thanksgiving meal between the Pilgrim settlers and the Wampanoag tribe <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>. Instead, it has been suggested they ate deer, along with other wild fowl, such as goose or duck.  Turkey was a key part <b>of</b> <b>Hale</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> Thanksgiving vision. She drew on Bradford&rsquo;s text&mdash;which was stolen by the British during the Revolutionary War but resurfaced in 1854&mdash;in order to build up the...  Upon sitting down to a lackluster, turkey-less Thanksgiving feast at the turn of the <b>19th</b> <b>century</b>, founding father Alexander Hamilton once remarked, &ldquo;No citizen of the U.S. shall refrain from...  <b>Turkey</b>, a <b>Thanksgiving</b> staple so ubiquitous it has become all but synonymous with the holiday, may or may not have been on offer when the Pilgrims hosted the inaugural feast in 1621. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving decoration craft projects.
