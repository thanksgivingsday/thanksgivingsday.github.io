        <p>From the landing on <b>Plymouth</b> <b>Rock</b> to the harmonious feast with the native Wampanoags, the story about the Pilgrims &mdash; and by extension, the story of <b>Thanksgiving</b> &mdash; is rife with myth and inaccuracy.

One of these <b>Indians</b>, a young man named Squanto, spoke fluent English and had been appointed by Massasoit to serve as the pilgrim&rsquo;s translator and guide.  On the 400th anniversary of the landing at <b>Plymouth</b> <b>Rock</b>, it&rsquo;s worth remembering the true story of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> and all the Native lives lost at the hands of English settlers.  In American lore, friendly <b>Indians</b> helped freedom-loving colonists. In real life, the Wampanoags had a problem they didn&rsquo;t know how to fix.
