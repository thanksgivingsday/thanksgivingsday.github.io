        <p>On October 3, 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation designating &ldquo;the last Thursday of November next, as a <b>day</b> of Thanksgiving.&rdquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s announcement marked the culmination of a multi-decade campaign by Sarah Josepha Hale to make Thanksgiving into a <b>national</b> holiday.  We want to express thanks to God and to His people for sustaining the ongoing, vital work of organizations like the <b>National</b> <b>Day</b> of <b>Prayer</b>. In 2021, we will be mobilizing millions of God&rsquo;s people and calling them to pray for America. Our theme is Lord, Pour Out Your LOVE, LIFE AND LIBERTY.  On this <b>National</b> <b>Day</b> of <b>Prayer</b>, first called for more than 225 years ago by the Continental Congress, we come together to thank God for our Nation&rsquo;s many blessings, to acknowledge our need for His wisdom and grace, and to ask Him to continue to watch over our country in the days ahead.  1789: President George Washington declares <b>November</b> <b>26th</b>, a national day of thanksgiving. 1815: President James Madison declares a national day of prayer and thanksgiving. 1827: Sarah Josepha Hale writes essays calling for an annual national celebration of thanksgiving.

[8]  and also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our <b>national</b> and other transgressions&mdash;to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually&mdash;to render our <b>national</b> ...  George Washington was the first president to proclaim a <b>day</b> of thanksgiving, issuing his request on October 3, 1789, exactly 74 years before Lincoln&#39;s. The document below sets apart the last Thursday of November &quot;as a day of Thanksgiving <b>and</b> Praise.&quot;  Washington&rsquo;s first proclamation after his inauguration as the nation&rsquo;s first president in 1789 declared November 26, 1789, as a <b>national</b> <b>day</b> of &ldquo;thanksgiving and <b>prayer</b>.&rdquo; 1800s: The annual presidential thanksgiving proclamations ceased for 45 years in the early 1800s. 1863: President Abraham Lincoln resumed the tradition in 1863 ... </p>        <p>Buffalo bills thanksgiving day games.
