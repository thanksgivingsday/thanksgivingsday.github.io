        <p>The Ultimate Guide to <b>Making</b> DIY <b>Burlap</b> <b>Wreaths</b>. If you love to <b>make</b> <b>wreaths</b>, then DIY <b>burlap</b> <b>wreaths</b> are a must for you to try! They are easy to <b>make</b> and so versatile. <b>Burlap</b> works as a great neutral base for a variety of different <b>wreath</b> embellishments. There is no one way to <b>make</b> <b>a burlap</b> <b>wreath</b>, so I&rsquo;ve created the ultimate guide for you.  Looking for an easy tutorial on how to <b>make</b> <b>a burlap</b> <b>wreath</b>? I have just the thing for you! This <b>wreath</b> is gorgeous any time of the year, particularly if you...  To create this ruffly <b>burlap</b> <b>wreath</b>, start by securing the end of the 6&Prime; <b>burlap</b> ribbon to the underside of the wire <b>wreath</b> form. Start by pulling the sides of the ribbon up parallel to one of the two inner wires (we&rsquo;ll use both wires, one at a time), kind of creating a taco shape with the <b>burlap</b> and the wire.  Now here&#39;s a <b>wreath</b> that looks like a party! It may take a few steps, but this beauty is well worth the effort. Begin by cutting large pieces of cardboard into three rectangles, 3 by 6 inches, 3 by 7 inches, and 3 by 71&frasl;2 inches. Wrap the teal raffia lengthwise around the 6-inch rectangle as many times as possib  There are three popular techniques for <b>making</b> <b>a burlap</b> <b>wreath</b>: Push-Up: Push the <b>burlap</b> through the spaces between the wires of the <b>wreath</b> frame and squish it together to create a full effect. Ruffle : Fold the <b>burlap</b> in half and wrap it around the wires of the <b>wreath</b> frame, pulling it through to create a ruffled effect.  Grapevine <b>wreaths</b> are one of my favorite ways to <b>make</b> beautiful <b>wreaths</b> quickly &ndash; right behind ruffle <b>wreaths</b>! We asked our friend from <b>Burlap</b> Bowtique to teach us how she makes her beautiful, simple <b>burlap</b> <b>wreath</b>. This technique will give you the perfect base for a ruffled DIY <b>burlap</b> <b>wreath</b> that you can take and decorate any way that you want.  Step 3: Next, begin to work with your printed <b>burlap</b>. Create a two-loop bow with the printed <b>burlap</b> and lay it on the <b>wreath</b> on the outer layer of the form over a wire stem (but between the outer and inner layers of the plain <b>burlap</b>).  You can use <b>burlap</b> ribbon, lace, strips of fabric, whatever you like, to <b>make</b> these <b>wreaths</b>. Let&rsquo;s take a tour of this thing &ndash; the metal form has 4 metal rings (inner, 2 in the middle,and an outer), the supports holding the rings together, and 3 &lsquo;slots&rsquo; &ndash; these slots between the rings, are where you&rsquo;re going to essentially shove ...
