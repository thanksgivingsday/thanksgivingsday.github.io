        <p>ARLINGTON, Va. &minus; Some of the millions of Americans planning to run or walk those iconic turkey trots this Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> ahead of those big holiday meals should be bracing for bitter cold or ...  In honor of these wonderful, inspirational events, we&rsquo;ve put together this list of Top 25 Thanksgiving Turkey <b>Trot</b> Runs &mdash; the largest, most historic, most scenic, and unique Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> road races in the country.  The first Turkey <b>Trot</b> was held on Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> in 1896 in Buffalo, New York. It was an eight-kilometer race hosted by the YMCA; six people participated, and only four finished. People have run the Turkey <b>Trot</b> every year since &mdash; through blizzards and pandemics &mdash; making it the oldest race in North America.  Let&rsquo;s break down the Turkey <b>Trot</b> tradition and why you might want to consider running one this year. What is a Thanksgiving Turkey <b>Trot</b>? This running race takes place on Thanksgiving, usually in the morning. A Turkey <b>Trot</b> is often a 5k (3.1 miles) or longer. You can opt to run the race, walk the race, or do a run/walk hybrid.  Turkey <b>trots</b> are footraces, usually of the long-distance variety, held on or around Thanksgiving Day in the United States. The name is derived from the use of turkey as a common centerpiece of the Thanksgiving dinner .  Perhaps that&rsquo;s why in 2015, Thanksgiving eclipsed the Fourth <b>of</b> <b>July</b> as the most popular day to run a race. But did you know that this growing modern phenomenon&rsquo;s roots were set way back in...  The York YMCA Turkey <b>Trot</b> is the way to start Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>. Cori Strathmeyer&#39;s husband, Brian, started running with three of their children &mdash; Brad, Brian II, and Paige &mdash; in the Turkey <b>Trot</b> ...  Starting your Thanksgiving with a Turkey <b>Trot</b> can significantly boost your energy levels for the entire <b>day</b>. Physical activity releases endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. This natural high can help you approach the <b>day</b>&rsquo;s festivities with increased enthusiasm and positivity, making you better prepared to deflect those unwanted ...
