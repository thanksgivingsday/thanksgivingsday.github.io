        <h2><strong>History you are the historian thanksgiving La thanksgiving traffic jam</strong></h2>
        <p><b>You</b> Are The <b>Historian</b>: Investigating the First <b>Thanksgiving</b> focuses primarily on events leading up to the 1621 harvest feast &ndash; known today as &ldquo;the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; &ndash; while also putting the events in a broader historical context to explore how historians&rsquo; interpretation of the early years of Patuxet and Plymouth Colony has changed ...  Americans have long thought the history of the American holiday Thanksgiving to be relatively simple. The actual story of how the story of &ldquo;the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was written and retold and how the holiday was developed and embraced by a nation is surprisingly complex.  To help students investigate what the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal really looked like, Plimoth Patuxet collaborated with FableVision to update their highly popular <b>You</b> Are The <b>Historian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> interactive in time for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> season 2020 and the 400th commemoration of the Pilgrims&rsquo; arrival on the shores of Patuxet in 1620.  The Plimoth Plantation has designed a comprehensive online site that builds students&rsquo; understanding about the harvest celebration of 1621, which is often erroneously referred to as &ldquo;The First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo;  This interactive Web site from Plimoth Plantation, a Smithsonian Affiliate, focuses on clarifying fact and fiction surrounding the &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; Students use audio from Plimoth Plantation historians, images of artifacts, and a glossary to answer questions and explore the lives of the Wamapan&hellip;  &ldquo;You are the <b>Historian</b>&rdquo; Interactive Game. Get transported to Patuxet, the pre-European homeland of the Wampanoag, and be immersed in a story of cultural change and persistence that spans <b>12,000</b> <b>years</b>.  Plimoth Plantation just launched a new online learning center focused on the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The site is titled &lsquo;<b>You</b> are the <b>Historian</b>: Investigation the First Thanksgiving.  learn about the facts and myths that surround the &quot;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; (the harvest celebration of 1621) at Plimoth Colony. learn about the role that historians play in the collection and dissemination of history.  As you work through this guide, you and your students will use the skills of historians to peel away the layers of myth and misconception surrounding The First <b>Thanksgiving</b> and discover what might really have happened during the fall of 1621. </p>        <p>Restaurant chains open on thanksgiving day 2024.
