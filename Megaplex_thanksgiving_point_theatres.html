        <p>Pilgrims&rsquo; <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Recipes. If you&rsquo;re looking to make history with this year&rsquo;s holiday meal, these recipes based on <b>foods</b> from the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> may give you the opportunity to do just that. While clearly not replicating recipes and procedures of the era, they are delicious just the same! Pumpkin Shell Custard. Ingredients:  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the Pilgrims did <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, <b>were</b> ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks <b>were</b> probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  There&rsquo;s a good chance the Pilgrims and Wampanoag did in fact <b>eat</b> turkey as part of that very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Wild turkey was a common <b>food</b> source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds. Did they come back with any turkey?  Only 5 percent of this <b>food</b> was served <b>at</b> the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>. There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was <b>eaten</b> as corn ...  Like many of the <b>foods</b> <b>eaten</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, American chestnuts <b>were</b> probably prepared multiple ways for the occasion. Ground chestnuts, along with walnuts, beechnuts, and acorns commonly served as thickeners in stew, or sobaheg, in the Wampanoag language. Another possibility is that chestnuts <b>were</b> used for stuffing inside roasted birds.  What They (Likely) Did Have <b>at</b> the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Venison; Fowl (geese and duck) Corn; Nuts (walnuts, chestnuts, beechnuts) Shellfish; So venison was a major ingredient, as well as fowl, but that likely included geese and ducks. Turkeys are a possibility, but <b>were</b> not a common <b>food</b> in that time. Pilgrims grew onions and herbs.  Courses and sides that <b>were</b> definitely not on the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> table To some extent, the exercise of reimagining the spread of <b>food</b> at the 1621 celebration becomes a process of elimination.  But if one <b>were</b> to create a historically accurate feast, consisting of only those <b>foods</b> that historians are certain <b>were</b> served at the so-called &ldquo;<b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; there would be slimmer ... </p>        <p>Rice crispy treats thanksgiving.
