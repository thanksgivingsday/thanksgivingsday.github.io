        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving history eating turkey Happy thanksgiving to all washington post</strong></h2>
        <p>This isn&#39;t just any <b>car</b>, it&#39;s the iconic KITT from Knight Rider, one of the most popular <b>cars</b> in TV history. KITT was a <b>car</b> that was ahead of its time, packed with science fiction AI and the latest cutting-edge technology. It was driven by none other than David Hasselhoff, who played the iconic Michael Knight in the hit TV series. The <b>car</b> was ...  The obvious trick was that, for shots of <b>K.I.T.T</b>. driving itself, a stunt driver was lowered in a special seat out of camera view to drive the <b>car</b>. It was also modified in season 4 with a different seat. To top it off, throughout Seasons 2 &amp; 3, to save on budget, several scenes weren&rsquo;t even real <b>cars</b> but miniatures.  <b>KITT </b>can also project his voice as a loudspeaker or as a form of ventriloquism (First used <b>in </b>Episode 48, &quot;Knight of the Drones, Pt. 2&quot;). <b>KITT </b>has a hidden switch and setting dial under the dash that either completely shuts down his AI module or deactivates certain systems should the need arise. First used <b>in </b>Episode 17, &quot;Chariot of Gold&quot;.  There were bids for the <b>car</b> in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, with the promise that if the winning bid was over 25% of the reserve price, Hasselhoff would personally deliver the vehicle ...  Ho-ly <b>K.I.T.T</b>.: Directed by Lea Thompson. With Wendi McLendon-Covey, Sean Giambrone, Troy Gentile, Hayley Orrantia. Adam gets between Murray and Marvin when they go without him to the Philadelphia <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day parade to see <b>K.I.T.T</b>. from &quot;Knight Rider&quot; in person.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch turbo boost,&rdquo; said KITT. &ldquo;Something tells me you shouldn&rsquo;t touch turbo boost.&rdquo; KITT, the futuristic Pontiac Trans Am from the 1980s hit show Knight Rider, changed the way we saw our <b>cars</b>. Sure, we had Herbie the VW and Stephen King&rsquo;s Christine, a possessed 1958 Plymouth Fury. But KITT was different.  Joe Huth is a dedicated &quot;Knight Rider&quot; historian who owns one of the original KITT <b>cars</b> used in the 1980s television series. His passion for the show led him to co-author &quot;Knight Rider: 30 Years of a Lone Crusader and His Talking <b>Car</b>&quot; and establish the &quot;Knight Rider Historians&quot; website  RELATED: Cadillac&#39;s Vaunted Super Cruise Now Allows Hands-Free Lane Changes It starts with the basic Normal Cruise, where the driver is <b>in </b>control and <b>KITT </b>takes over only if necessary, Auto Cruise is the mode that allows solely <b>KITT </b>to drive, Pursuit mode is similar to Normal Cruise except it&#39;s used <b>in </b>high-speed driving and sticky situations where the driver can&#39;t react fast enough.  KITT&rsquo;s Turbo Boost allowed the <b>car</b> to both accelerate to top speed and launch the <b>car</b> upwards to jump over obstacles. This boost was aided by two rocket boosters mounted behind the front wheels. KITT&rsquo;s body is constructed with a Tri-Helical Plasteel 1000 Molecular Bonded Shell. </p>        <p>Ready for thanksgiving quotes. Walmart open thanksgiving massachusetts.
