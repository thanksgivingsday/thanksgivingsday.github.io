        <h2><strong>Received with thanksgiving kjv Restaurants open for thanksgiving in savannah</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada that celebrates the blessings of the past year. How did <b>Thanksgiving</b> start? Colonists in <b>New</b> England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests.  In commemoration, a non-denominational <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day service is held each year on the morning of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in the Pieterskerk, a Gothic church in Leiden, noting the hospitality the Pilgrims received in Leiden on their way to <b>the New</b> <b>World</b>. [52] <b>Thanksgiving</b> is observed by orthodox Protestant churches in the Netherlands on ...  According to the mythology behind the first Thanksgiving in 1621, the <b>Pilgrims</b> met a &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; Native American named Squanto in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to plant corn, and the settlers enjoyed a hearty feast with their new native friend.  Squanto was to become <b>the </b>primary force behind <b>the </b>Pilgrims&rsquo; unlikely survival in <b>the New World</b>. On March 22, 1621, <b>the </b>vernal equinox, Squanto walked out <b>of the </b>forest into <b>the </b>middle <b>of the </b>Pilgrims&rsquo; ramshackle base at Plymouth, a settlement known to Squanto as Patuxet.  Within a hundred years, Thanksgiving became a <b>New</b> England custom, but its transformation into a national holiday is due to a long campaign by a nineteenth-century writer, Sarah Josepha Hale. Hale described a perfect Thanksgiving dinner in her novel Northwood (1827), with turkey in pride of place.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans...  In September 1620, a small ship called <b>the </b>Mayflower left Plymouth, England, carrying 102 passengers&mdash;an assortment <b>of </b>religious separatists seeking a <b>new </b>home where they could freely practice their...  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Originally an English tradition, days <b>of thanksgiving</b> typically were marked by religious services to give thanks to God, or to celebrate a bountiful harvest.
