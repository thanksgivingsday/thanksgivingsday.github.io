        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving prep timeline Thanksgiving events sudbury</strong></h2>
        <p>In Canada, Parliament established a national Thanksgiving Day in <b>1879</b>. Thanksgiving Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year.  Canadian Thanksgiving traces its roots to an old European farming custom of banding together to toast a plentiful harvest. After hundreds of years of unofficial celebration, the Canadian Parliament officially recognized the folk practice in <b>1957</b>.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is rooted in Indigenous values, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies. However, the concept of <b>thanksgiving</b> was influenced by our American neighbours.  It was not until <b>31</b> <b>January</b> <b>1957</b> that Parliament proclaimed &ldquo;a day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed,&rdquo; to be observed on the second Monday in October.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of Thanksgiving and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating <b>on</b> <b>October</b> <b>14th</b>. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated in <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  Canada celebrated Thanksgiving <b>decades</b> <b>before</b> the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common.  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions . </p>        <p>Bobs burgers episode indecent thanksgiving proposal.
