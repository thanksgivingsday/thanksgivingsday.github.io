        <h2><strong>The history of thanksgiving ana Bejewelled thanksgiving game</strong></h2>
        <p>The double <b>Thanksgiving</b> continued for two more years, and then on December 26, 1941, Roosevelt signed a joint resolution of Congress changing the official national <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> to the fourth Thursday in November starting in 1942 (there are usually four but sometimes five Thursdays in November, depending on the <b>year</b>).  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> is a national holiday in the United States, and <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2022 occurs on Thursday, November 24. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared an autumn harvest ...  The Detroit Lions hosted a game <b>every</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> from 1934 to 1938 and have hosted one <b>every</b> <b>year</b> since 1945. [99] In 1966, the Dallas Cowboys , which were founded six years earlier, adopted the practice of hosting <b>Thanksgiving</b> games. [ 100 ]  There are claims that the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> was <b>held</b> in the city of El Paso, Texas, in 1598. Another early event was <b>held</b> in 1619 in the Virginia Colony. Many people trace the origins of the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> to the harvest celebration the Pilgrims <b>held</b> in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621.  <b>Every</b> <b>year</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on the fourth Thursday of November. However, <b>Thanksgiving</b> used to be celebrated on the last Thursday of the month. In 1863, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln gave the <b>Thanksgiving</b> proclamation and asked for Americans to set aside the last Thursday of November as a <b>day</b> of <b>thanksgiving</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been <b>held</b> on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each <b>year</b>. The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  America&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday, born in the 1500s, mythologized in 1621, and observed even during the bleakest hours of the Civil War, now stands as one of the nation&rsquo;s most anticipated and beloved days &mdash; celebrated each <b>year</b> on the fourth Thursday in November (November 28, 2024).  The earliest celebration was <b>held</b> in 1578, when an expedition led by Martin Frobisher <b>held</b> a ceremony in present-<b>day</b> Nunavut to give thanks for the safety of its fleet. In 1879 Parliament established a national <b>Thanksgiving Day</b> on November 6; the date has varied over the years. Since 1957 <b>Thanksgiving Day</b> has been celebrated in Canada on the ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past <b>year</b>. Variations of the holiday are celebrated in the Caribbean and elsewhere. </p>        <p><a href="./423.html">Gender reveal on thanksgiving</a>. The hub 30a thanksgiving.
