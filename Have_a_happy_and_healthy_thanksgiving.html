The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  That <b>first</b> <b>Mass</b> was celebrated on September 8, 1565. Kansas is also the site of a <b>Mass</b> celebrated on June 29, 1541 .
