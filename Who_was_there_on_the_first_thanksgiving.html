        <p>1. After the <b>turkey</b> is roasted (white and dark meat) cover loosely with foil and let sit for 1-2 hours <b>BEFORE</b> refrigerating. 2. Refrigerate whole pieces, DO NOT SLICE YET 3. <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>day</b>: Remove from refrigerator about 30 &ndash; 45 minutes <b>before</b> slicing. 4. Slice ONLY what you will need for <b>the day</b>. 5.  Although making the <b>turkey</b> ahead takes just as much time to prepare, it requires very little time on <b>the day</b> of your holiday meal. Spreading out the <b>cooking</b> over several days and making as much ahead as possible are the best ways I know to have a low-stress, relaxing <b>Thanksgiving</b> or holiday meal.  The day before you plan to roast the turkey, remove the plastic wrap and leave the turkey in the fridge. The skin will dry out and turn a little translucent. Preheat the oven to <b>325</b>&deg;<b>F</b> (<b>165</b>&deg;<b>F</b>).  Step 1, The <b>day</b> <b>before</b> serving, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Step 2, Put the thyme and rosemary on the bottom of a baking sheet. Put the <b>turkey</b> pieces on top, dot with the cubed butter...  With this technique, <b>cooking</b> <b>turkey</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b>, the week before, or even the month before, still tastes delicious and freshly carved. Of all the easy Thanksgiving turkey recipes out there, this one just works.  <b>Cook</b> a delicious <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>turkey</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> with our easy recipe! Tips and tricks to make sure your <b>turkey</b> is juicy and flavorful.  It&rsquo;s easy: Simply cook it a day or <b>two</b> in advance, let it cool completely, then carve <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>into</b> <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b>&mdash;<b>breasts</b>, <b>wings</b>, <b>thighs</b> <b>and</b> <b>drumsticks</b>. Store in a container in the refrigerator until the big day. This method actually result in juicier meat&mdash;and an infinitely more relaxed host.  Here are the steps for making a moist &amp; juicy make-ahead <b>turkey</b>!! Thaw the <b>turkey</b>: You need a 12-14 pound <b>turkey</b> for this recipe. I actually used a 23-pound <b>turkey</b>. Thaw the <b>turkey</b> in the refrigerator. It needs to be totally thawed about 3 days prior to <b>the day</b> you&rsquo;re serving it. Look at your packaging for proper thawing directions.  Whole <b>turkey</b> or <b>turkey</b> breast can be roasted and carved ahead and reheats beautifully with these easy instructions.
