        <h2><strong>Plymouth thanksgiving parade time Free thanksgiving lessons for kindergarten</strong></h2>
        <p>The origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day are believed to lie in a first harvest celebration held in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621. It always falls between November 22 and November 28. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is the day with the highest food consumption of the year.  <b>Thanksgiving Day</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United States ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2024 (also known as <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day) is an important federal holiday, celebrated annually on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2024 precedes &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; and is traditionally a holiday to give thanks for the food collected at the end of the harvest season.  Many American cities hold road running events, known as &quot;turkey trots&quot;, on <b>Thanksgiving</b> morning, so much so that as of 2018, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is the most popular race day in the U.S. [119] Depending on the organizations involved, these can range from one-mile (1.6 km) fun runs to full marathons (although no races currently use the latter; the ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> comes again! &ndash;Unknown &ldquo;An optimist is a person who starts a new diet on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day.&rdquo; &ndash;Irv Kupcinet, American columnist (1912&ndash;2003) &ldquo;Radical historians now tell the story of <b>Thanksgiving</b> from the point of view of the turkey.&rdquo; &ndash;Mason Cooley, U.S. aphorist . Happy <b>Thanksgiving</b>!  But the very first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was actually in 1623, giving thanks for the rain that ended a drought. The holiday spread to various dates in different communities and even more than once a year. The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day was proclaimed by George Washington, the first president of the United States, on November 26, 1789.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day has been an annual holiday in the United States since 1863. However, not everyone sees <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day as a cause for celebration. Some in the US Native American community feel the mythology of the holiday ignores the destruction of indigenous cultures that followed European settlement.  Another American <b>Thanksgiving</b> tradition is the Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade. The Parade began, even before <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a legal holiday, in 1924. That year Macy&rsquo;s employees marched through New York City from 145th St. down to 35th St. </p>        <p>Grand america garden cafe thanksgiving. Sausage mushroom dressing recipe thanksgiving.
