        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving poems to teachers Easy vegetable casserole for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Psalms 40:1-3 &quot;<b>I waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn  Learning how to <b>wait</b> <b>patiently</b> on the Lord is an acquired skill&mdash;and an essential one. David, who learned to do so in times of joy, exile, and conflict, wrote in Psalm 40:1 that he &ldquo;<b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b>&rdquo; for God. In fact, the Hebrew word qawa is repeated, which gives the verse a literal sense of &ldquo;to <b>wait</b>, <b>I waited</b> on the Lord.&rdquo; That ...  Philippians 4:6 &ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with <b>thanksgiving</b> let your requests be made known to God.&rdquo; Romans 12:12 &ldquo;Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.&rdquo; Psalm 40:1 &ldquo;<b>I waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry.&rdquo;  David recalls that he <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for the Lord to answer his urgent prayer. The Hebrew construction here uses the same root word twice, with different tenses. This most literally means something like &quot;<b>waited</b>, <b>waited</b>,&quot; or &quot;<b>I waited</b> to <b>wait</b>.&quot; This technique indicates David&#39;s perseverance in prayer for the Lord to answer.  Psalm 40:1-2. <b>I waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for the Lord &mdash; Hebrew, קוה קויתי, kavvo kivviti, in <b>waiting</b> <b>I waited</b>, or, in hoping I hoped, which doubling of the word signifies that he <b>waited</b> or hoped diligently and earnestly, <b>patiently</b> and perseveringly, until God should be pleased to help him.  Hurry up and <b>wait</b>. That&rsquo;s life. As the saying goes, life happens while you are <b>waiting</b>. For all of the <b>waiting</b> we do are any of us good at it. The writer of Psalm 40 says he <b>waited</b> <b>patiently</b>, but did he? What can we learn about <b>waiting</b> from Psalm 40 &ndash; <b>I waited</b> <b>patiently</b>? Psalm 40. Psalm 40 is a psalm of <b>thanksgiving</b>.  Christians throughout history have instructed the faithful to <b>wait</b> proactively and productively. Martin Luther is thought to have answered the question, &ldquo;What would you do if you found out the world were <b>to end</b> tomorrow?&rdquo; by remarking, &ldquo;Plant a tree.&rdquo; What do you <b>wait</b> for <b>patiently</b> even if painfully?  To many Christians, <b>Christmas</b> is considered a season of <b>waiting</b> and wondering. For centuries, Christians have prepared for <b>Christmas</b> by observing the season of Advent, beginning on the fourth Sunday before <b>Christmas</b>. People observe Advent differently&mdash;some with candles and traditional prayers, others with Advent wreaths and daily Bible readings.  For the music director. A Psalm of David. <b>I waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for the LORD; And He reached down to me and heard my cry. NASB 1995 For the choir director. A Psalm of David. <b>I waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for the LORD; And He inclined to me and heard my cry. NASB 1977 <b>I Waited</b> <b>patiently</b> for the LORD; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry.
