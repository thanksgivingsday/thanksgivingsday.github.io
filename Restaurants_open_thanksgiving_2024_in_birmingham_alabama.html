        <h2><strong>Restaurants open thanksgiving 2024 in birmingham alabama Why does cowboys play every thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony in...  Today&rsquo;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes. However, the very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> most likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  So what <b>foods</b> were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Have you ever wondered what the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>ate</b> at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  For most people, enjoying <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> pie. But how did the Pilgrims really...  One of the dishes at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was venison, brought by the Wampanoag. The Wampanoag hunters arrived with five freshly hunted deer, which was a generous gift, considering <b>food</b> wasn&rsquo;t always easy to come by. Venison roasted over an open flame provided much-needed protein for the <b>Pilgrims</b> and symbolized the Native people&rsquo;s ...  So, to the question &ldquo;What did the Pilgrims eat for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; the answer is both surprising and <b>expected</b>. <b>Turkey</b> (<b>probably</b>), <b>venison</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and all of the vegetables that they had planted and harvested that <b>year</b>&mdash;<b>onions</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>spinach</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, and other greens. </p>        <p><strong>Restaurants open thanksgiving 2024 in birmingham alabama</strong>.
