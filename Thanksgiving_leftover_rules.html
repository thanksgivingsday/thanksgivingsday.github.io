        <p>The history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been muddled, debunked, and rewritten throughout history, but here&rsquo;s why we carve a turkey and mash some potatoes each year.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a popular North American holiday that is central to the origin story of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, but other <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations may have taken place earlier.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day of Hale and Lincoln was a domestic event, a day of family homecoming, a mythical and nostalgic idea of the hospitality, civility and happiness of the American family. The purpose of the festival was no longer a communal celebration, but rather a domestic event, carving out a sense of national identity and welcoming home ...  The real history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> isn&#39;t the rosy story you learned as a kid. This is what really happened and why we need to remember.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  The colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of <b>thanksgiving</b> for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred on <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida. </p>        <p>Free thanksgiving math activities for kindergarten.
