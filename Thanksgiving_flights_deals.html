        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving flights deals Thanksgiving basket collection</strong></h2>
        <p>According to one expert, the US had a heavy influence on what <b>Canadians</b> traditionally eat every <b>Thanksgiving</b>. But there are a few interesting differences when it comes to this annual great...  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is rooted in Indigenous values, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  First Nations across Turtle Island have traditions of <b>thanksgiving</b> for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. These traditions may include feasting, prayer, dance, potlatch, and other ceremonies, depending on the peoples giving thanks.  Like its American counterpart, <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a time to express gratitude and appreciation for the bountiful harvest and blessings received throughout the year. However, <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> has unique origins and customs that set it apart.  Her Offbeat Partner: Derik, video game tester and organizational psychology student. Location &amp; date of <b>wedding</b>: Old Montreal, QC, Canada &mdash; October 10th 2009 (<b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>) What made our <b>wedding</b> offbeat: At first, we were planning a <b>wedding</b> with guests, but we quickly realized that we couldn&#39;t agree on anything.  It may be surprising to hear that <b>Canadian</b> Thanksgiving is actually older than its southern counterpart&#39;s celebration. There are also some differences between how the holidays are celebrated across borders. Here&#39;s why Canadians celebrate, and how they get together to make the holiday happen. Why do Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving?  <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, celebrated on the second Monday in October, is a rich blend of history, culture, and tradition. From Martin Frobisher&#39;s 1578 expedition to modern-day family feasts, this holiday reflects Canada&#39;s diverse heritage. </p>        <p>Run for pie fundraiser on thanksgiving.
