        <h2><strong>Where and when was the first thanksgiving Healthy thanksgiving sides pinterest</strong></h2>
        <p>Je&ucirc;ne <b>Genevois</b>: Je&ucirc;ne Genevois is celebrated on the Thursday following the first Sunday in September. This cantonal holiday is celebrated in Canton Geneva as a fasting day for penitence and thanksgiving. Plum tarts are often served as dessert on this day. August 1 &ndash; Swiss National Day. The biggest holiday as you can imagine is Swiss ...  The federal day for the Swiss is what we know as Thanksgiving&rsquo;s day, repentance, and prayer. The Swiss Federal Day of Thanksgiving takes place on the third Sunday of every <b>September</b>. It&rsquo;s known as Je&ucirc;ne f&eacute;d&eacute;ral in French, Digiuno Federale in Italian, Eidgen&ouml;ssischer Dank-, Buss- und Bettag and Rogaziun federala in Romansh.  The Swiss Federal Day of Thanksgiving, Repentance and Prayer is on <b>Sunday</b>, <b>September</b> <b>17th</b>. Here&rsquo;s how the Swiss celebrate the public holiday - and where.  I explained that though <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditionally celebrates the first feast shared between Native Americans and Colonial settlers &mdash; for my family, having lived in California, then Connecticut, then <b>Switzerland</b>, the holiday has become far more symbolic than a family colonial feast.  Although we associate <b>Thanksgiving</b> with the United States, other countries like Canada, Germany, Austria, and <b>Switzerland</b> also <b>celebrate</b> it. Though the idea behind is similar across the world, every country has its own unique ways of celebrating it.  An overview of <b>Switzerland</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> public holidays. While some Swiss vacations are observed across the nation, other festivities are only marked in specific regions around the country. Many of these are religious and are usually observed only in the cantons where Catholicism is the main religion.  The Federal Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Repentance and Prayer (German: Eidgen&ouml;ssischer Dank-, Buss- und Bettag, French: Je&ucirc;ne f&eacute;d&eacute;ral, Italian: Digiuno federale) <b>is </b>a public holiday <b>in Switzerland</b>. It <b>is </b>an interfaith feast observed by Roman Catholic dioceses, the Old Catholic Church , the Jewish and Muslim congregations and the Reformed church ...  The 26 cantons that make up Switzerland set their public holidays independently &ndash; with the exception of <b>1</b> August, [1] which is the only federal holiday. [2] Furthermore, holidays can change depending on employers, and some holidays are specific to only a certain town or village.  Federal <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Switzerland</b> is recognised as a holiday in all but one <b>Swiss</b> canton, but as it always falls on the third Sunday in September (September 15, 2024), most workers are not given it as a day off. </p>        <p>A turkey for thanksgiving the book.
