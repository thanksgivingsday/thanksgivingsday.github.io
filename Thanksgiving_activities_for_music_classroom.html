        <p>Instructions For the stuffing: In a large skillet, melt the butter. Once hot, add the onion, celery, and a big pinch of salt. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.  Combine the butter, olive oil, and seasonings for the rub in a small bowl and set aside. Place the onion and carrot chunks in the bottom of a 13- x 9-inch baking dish and lay the lemon and sprigs of rosemary over the top.  Carrots: Earthy, sweet, and the perfect hearty compliment to the juicy Cornish <b>hen</b>, onions and potatoes. Shallots: For a little punch and sweetness, shallots become tender and jammy. Olive oil: For tossing with the shallots, potatoes, and veggies so that they get tender-crisp under the <b>hens</b>. Cornish <b>hens</b>: You&#39;ll need two 1.5 lb. Cornish <b>hens</b>.  Cornish <b>game</b> <b>hens</b> are miniature chickens that are perfect for entertaining! There is something about these little <b>game</b> <b>hens</b> that makes them look so much more impressive than the plain regular roast chicken :) Especially when the Cornish <b>hens</b> are perfectly roasted and browned, everybody&rsquo;s mouth will water when they see them on a platter, so delicious!  Roast in the preheated oven until <b>hens</b> are nicely browned, 35 to 45 minutes. Tent the <b>hens</b> with foil during the last few minutes of cooking to prevent overbrowning, if needed.  Cornish <b>Game</b> <b>Hens</b> with Lemon, Garlic Rosemary and Thyme &ndash; tender and juice <b>hens</b> brined and seasoned to perfection. Wild Rice Pilaf with Pearl Onions, Cranberries and Apricots &ndash; a delicious pilaf filled with dried fruits, toasted pecans and pearl onions.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the sliced onion in the bottom of a roasting pan. Remove the giblets from the <b>hens</b>, and rinse them inside and out.  Cornish <b>game</b> <b>hens</b>: Of course, you&#39;ll need Cornish <b>game</b> <b>hens</b>. Olive oil: Olive oil locks in moisture and gives the salt and pepper something to stick to. Herbs and spices: You&#39;ll season the outside of the <b>hens</b> with salt and pepper, then stuff the cavities with fresh rosemary. You&#39;ll roast garlic alongside the <b>hens</b>.  Rub <b>hens</b> with butter; add onion and celery to pan and place <b>hens</b> on top: Preheat oven to 450˚F. Rub 1 tablespoon butter all over the skin of each <b>game</b> <b>hen</b>; season with salt and pepper. Scatter the onion, celery, and thyme in a roasting pan.
