        <p>There are two major factors to consider when navigating crowd levels at <b>Disneyland</b>: events happening at the resort and school holidays. Those are often are our most two reliable Disneyland crowd <b>indicators</b>. So with that in mind, let&#39;s answer the question: &ldquo;When will it be crowded at Disneyland?&rdquo;  Thanksgiving is actually one of the busiest days of the year to visit Disneyland. Disneyland is open <b>365</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> year and this includes all major holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Year&rsquo;s Day.

Our first (and favorite) times to visit are the weeks before and after <b>Thanksgiving</b> week. Typically, Christmas season at <b>Disneyland</b> starts the <b>weekend</b> before this, meaning you have a week gap between the start of <b>Disneyland</b>&rsquo;s <b>holiday</b> season and the start of actual <b>holiday</b> travel. This is a &lsquo;sweet spot&rsquo; for low crowds, perfect weather, and ...  When Are the Busiest Times at <b>Disneyland</b>?

On <b>busy</b> days, those mobile order windows can feel dar away. So plan ahead for that. <b>Disneyland</b> at <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a great time to have dining reservations. Reservations open 60 days in advance usually about 6:00 a.m. We have a whole post about dining at <b>Disneyland</b> at <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which includes tips on where to dine.
