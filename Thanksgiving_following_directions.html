        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving following directions Some e cards thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Jefferson signed this proclamation for a <b>day</b> of &quot;Thanksgiving and Prayer,&quot; to be held on December 9, 1779. At that time, the General Assembly was responsible for formulating state government policies, not the governor.  This was simply a religious <b>day</b> of prayer and <b>fasting</b> that had nothing to do with the fall harvest. Over the years, the names of the two events became intertwined and by the late 1600s many individual colonies and settlements, began holding &ldquo;Thanksgiving feasts&rdquo; during the autumn months.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people.  In 1789 Congress invited newly-elected President, George Washington, to invite the nation to participate in a day of &ldquo;public thanksgiving and prayer.&rdquo; The chosen day was <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>26</b>, <b>1789</b>.  Days of Fasting were called on account of plagues <b>in</b> <b>1604</b> and 1622, drought in 1611, and floods in 1613. Annual Thanksgiving prayers were dictated by the charter of English settlers upon their safe landing in America in 1619 at Berkeley Hundred in Virginia. [5]  President Abraham Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a national <b>November</b> holiday by issuing two successive thanksgiving proclamations (1863, 1864), while the last national day of fasting was called in response to his assassination (1865).  And finally, I recommend that on the said <b>day</b> the duties of humiliation and prayer be accompanied by fervent thanksgiving to the Bestower of Every Good Gift, not only for His having hitherto protected and preserved the people of these United States in the independent enjoyment of their religious and civil freedom, but also for having prospered ...  The Thanksgiving holiday celebrated <b>each</b> <b>November</b> in the United States is a cherished American tradition, but its roots go far back into human history, according to research conducted by The Center for World Thanksgiving at Thanks-Giving Square.  President Abraham Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a national <b>November</b> holiday by issuing two successive thanksgiving proclamations (1863, 1864), while the last national day of fasting was called in response to his assassination (1865). </p>        <p><a href="./821.html">Spicy thanksgiving turkey</a>.
