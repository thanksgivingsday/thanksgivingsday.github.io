        <p>Although there is evidence of earlier <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations in the Americas by the Spanish in the 16th century and at the Jamestown Colony of Virginia in 1610, following what is known as the &ldquo;starving times&rdquo; of 1609, these are not recognized as the <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;, a term coined by the editor Alexander Young in 1841 referring ...  Ah, <b>Thanksgiving</b>: Time to dive face-<b>first</b> into mountains of mashed potatoes, count our blessings and if we&#39;re feeling really ambitious, ... In the <b>years</b> between 1630&ndash;1642 alone, about 25,000 ...  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two <b>years</b> later in 1623.

When Americans rediscovered Winslow&#39;s account in 1822, the unremarkable harvest feast of 1621 was elevated to become the <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; 6 By that time, American <b>Thanksgiving</b> practices had come to resemble that earlier feast. As it is celebrated today, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has very little to do with Plymouth in 1621.
