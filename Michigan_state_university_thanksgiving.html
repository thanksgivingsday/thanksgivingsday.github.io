        <p>So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden <b>meal</b> but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Venison: <b>The </b>Wampanoag brought deer to <b>the </b>feast, a generous offering that likely stole <b>the </b>spotlight.; Wildfowl: Think ducks, geese, and maybe turkey.; Seafood: Lobster, clams, and fish were ...  First Thanksgiving: No Turkey on the Table? There&rsquo;s no solid evidence that turkey was on the menu in late <b>1621</b>, when the Pilgrim settlers of Plymouth Colony sat down with indigenous Wampanoag...  The attendees of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> were a mixed group, united by survival rather than tradition. Over 90 Wampanoag men, including their leader Massasoit, joined the roughly 50 colonists.

Wall explains that the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday, as we know it, took root in the mid-19th century.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> lasted three days and was not an annual tradition (yet). Wampanoag leader Massasoit Ousamequin was there, as was Tisquantum (whom the settlers called Squanto). Tisquantum&#39;s knowledge of the English language (he learned while enslaved in Europe), had been critical to the colonists&#39; survival.  The <b>meal</b> consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were...  In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people. </p>        <p><a href="./35.html">Thanksgiving table runner etsy</a>.
