        <p>A <b>turf</b> war between the spouses and in-laws may ignite, since both parties want the partner&rsquo;s attention during the holidays. One way to end the war is to create a sense of &lsquo;we-ness&rsquo; with your partner so you&rsquo;re both more inclined to side with each other rather than the parents.  Looking for advice on how to deal with your in-<b>laws</b> during <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Working women discuss their traditions, trials and tribulations.  Use your <b>time</b> in the two days leading up to take advantage of that.&quot; &mdash; u/grains_r_us 8. &quot;...enlist the help of some family members in light cleanup (bringing the big plates into the kitchen, storing leftovers, and some light washing up) once everyone has eaten 2-3 times and the food is getting into the &quot;danger zone&quot; of being out too long.  Rule number one of hosting in-<b>laws</b> you don&rsquo;t love hanging out with: Never let the in-laws dictate when they&rsquo;re coming. Sure, they can make timing suggestions and offer up availabilities. But...  Don&rsquo;t worry though, GREY&rsquo;s got some tips and tricks to help you survive the evening. 1. Do Your Research. Every family celebrates <b>Thanksgiving</b> a little differently. Some families dress more formally, while others prefer something casual. Some families are vegetarian, others serve up deep-fried turducken.  Applying these skills ensures that <b>Thanksgiving</b> remains a <b>time</b> for gratitude and connection. Preparing as a Team. One of the best ways to handle <b>Thanksgiving</b> with in-<b>laws</b> is by preparing as a couple. Discuss the day&rsquo;s plans, including arrival and departure times, roles, and traditions. Premarital counseling fosters teamwork and problem-solving.  7 Ways to Survive the <b>Thanksgiving</b> Table with Your In-<b>Laws</b>. Feeling ready to spend quality time with your in-laws <b>this</b> holiday season? Or maybe not? We rounded up our fave tips on how to make it through what might feel like the longest dinner of your life.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> isn&rsquo;t just a meal&mdash;it&rsquo;s a performance, and these 15 recipes are the standing ovation moment. Whether you&rsquo;re hosting seasoned food critics disguised as in-<b>laws</b> or just aiming to avoid awkward silence. From classics with a clever twist to dishes that look way harder than they actually are, it&rsquo;s all about playing it smart.  A contentious presidential election, a Thanksgiving visit you may not have wanted and extended <b>time</b> with your partner&rsquo;s parents are the perfect recipe for a Thanksgiving disaster, especially when you&rsquo;re toeing the fine line of supporting your significant other without blowing up the entire holiday. </p>        <p>Is food basics open on thanksgiving.
