        <p>The <b>Macy</b>&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b> is an annual <b>parade</b> in New York City presented by the U.S.-based department store chain <b>Macy</b>&#39;s.The <b>Parade</b> <b>first</b> took place in 1924, [2]: 9 tying it for the second-oldest <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b> in the United States with America&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Parade</b> in Detroit (with both parades being four years younger than Philadelphia&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b>).  In <b>Macy</b>&#39;s <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b>, Santa Claus sat atop a float pulled by a team of horses down Broadway. That year floats, bands, and Central Park Zoo animals were featured in the procession. At the <b>parade</b>&#39;s end, Santa Claus was crowned &quot;King of the Kiddies&quot; on <b>Macy</b>&#39;s balcony at the 34th Street entrance.  NEW YORK CITY, N.Y. &mdash; The <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b>, an iconic American tradition, made its debut on November 27, 1924. Originally called the <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s Christmas <b>Parade</b>, the event was ...  When was the first televised Thanksgiving Parade? <b>In</b> <b>1948</b>, The Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade was nationally broadcasted for the first time on CBS. That was over 20 years after its inception, though it makes sense when you realize cable wasn&#39;t even invented until earlier that year.  The very <b>first</b> <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b> took place in 1924, when store employees marched to <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s Herald Square, dressed in costumes. It was not really covered by the media.  At 9 a.m. on the sunlit morning <b>of</b> <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1924</b>, Macy&rsquo;s gave the children of New York a particularly special Thanksgiving treat as a police escort led the start of the parade from the...  On Nov. 27, 1924 at 9 a.m., the <b>first</b> <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>parade</b> started its way down a 6-mile route through the main streets of New York City. Since then, the <b>parade</b> route has been trimmed to 2.5 miles and the <b>parade</b> has grown, becoming one of the most beloved American traditions and bringing millions of people together every <b>Thanksgiving</b> morning.  The <b>first</b>-ever <b>Macy</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>Parade</b> was held on November 27, 1924, in New York City. However, it wasn&rsquo;t broadcast on television until 1947, according to the Library of Congress.  The first Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, <b>held</b> <b>November</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1924</b>, was called &ldquo;Macy&rsquo;s Christmas Parade&rdquo; and aimed at ginning up demand for Christmas shopping. </p>        <p>La fitness crescent springs kentucky thanksgiving hours.
