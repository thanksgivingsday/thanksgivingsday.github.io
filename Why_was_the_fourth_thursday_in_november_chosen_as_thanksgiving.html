        <h2><strong>Why was the fourth thursday in november chosen as thanksgiving Thanksgiving food dishes</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>cornucopia</b> is typically a hollow, horn-shaped wicker <b>basket</b> filled with various seasonal fruits and vegetables. Though most Americans associate the <b>cornucopia</b> with the Thanksgiving holiday, it was around long before Columbus sailed to America.  The hollow, horn-shaped wicker <b>basket</b> is often filled to the brim with festive items like fall flowers, leaves, nuts, and fall fruits like gourds, mini pumpkins, and apples then is placed on a Thanksgiving table (or kitchen counter or entryway table) on the day of the big feast.  Here we give you a rundown of everything you need to know about the Thanksgiving <b>cornucopia</b> (pronounced kor&middot;nuh&middot; kow &middot;pee&middot;uh), its origins, and it symbolism. Knowing a bit about the horn-shaped <b>basket</b> is super to take your Thanksgiving trivia skills next level.  A <b>cornucopia</b> is a curved cone or horn-shaped <b>basket</b>, often woven or wicker, typically pictured as overflowing with <b>fruit</b>, vegetables, grains, and nuts to depict an abundant harvest. The very word, <b>cornucopia</b>, comes from Latin cornu (horn) and copia (abundance).  The modern <b>cornucopia</b> is typically a hollow, horn-shaped wicker <b>basket</b> filled with festive <b>fruit</b> and vegetables and has become closely tied to Thanksgiving. The first Thanksgiving was actually a celebration of the fall harvest and was a three-day festival between the Puritan Pilgrims and the Native Americans. </p>        <p>Third grade activities for thanksgiving.
