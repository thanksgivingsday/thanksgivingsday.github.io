        <p><b>Sermon</b> &ndash; <b>Thanksgiving</b> Sunday October 10, 2021 Happy Thanksgiving! Thanksgiving is a time to gather with family and friends. It&rsquo;s a time to pig out and eat too much food. This week, I came across a Thanksgiving blessing that I thought would be extremely relevant. It goes: May your stuffing be tasty May your turkey be plump  <b>Sermon</b> Outlines <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2 Corinthians 9:15 - &ldquo;Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.&rdquo; The Christian life has been called &ldquo;a life of continual thanksgiving&rdquo; ~ not simply thanksgiving at certain times but &ldquo;continual&rdquo; ~ &ldquo;giving thanks always&rdquo; (Eph. 5:20). In order for this we must realize what we have. St. Paul  Here are thirty-seven <b>sermons</b> appropriate for <b>Thanksgiving</b>. You are welcome to use this material in any way that might be helpful to you as you prepare sermons <b>and</b> Bible studies or simply to increase your own gratitude to the Lord for all his blessings.  Through Jesus&rsquo; miracle, this Samaritan learned Four Easy Steps To <b>Thanksgiving</b>. And, through his experience, we learn the same four steps. Stop, look, listen, and Praise God! Have you used this in your life? Perhaps it&rsquo;s the application of these steps that will keep this <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Sermon</b> from merely being another clich&eacute;d, canned nicety.  1 O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 2 Let us come before his presence with <b>thanksgiving</b>, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 3 For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.  A <b>THANKSGIVING</b> <b>SERMON</b> 1 CHRONICLES 16:1-36 INTRO: I am certain that EVERYONE OF US LOOKS FORWARD TO THE THANKSGIVING SEASON for various reasons. 1) For family gatherings. 2) For a vacation. 3) For Football. 4) For Rest. 5) For Food. Historically the THANKSGIVING SEASON has been a part of our heritage since the TIME OF THE PILGRIMS.  In a nutshell: <b>Thanksgiving</b> must be given to the one responsible for whatever it is that we are thankful for. Regardless of our blessings, everyone who has a relationship with God can give thanks to God for these three things: The Lord is Good; His love endures forever; and His faithfulness endures to all generations. B. History of <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  theology of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. &ldquo;Theology&rdquo; is the study of the doctrine of God. The theology behind our <b>thanksgiving</b> can be seen in a very familiar passage of scripture. It is Romans chapter 8. Here we read: &ldquo;And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.  MPT: It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will for Christians to give <b>thanks</b> in all circumstances. MPS: <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a command for all contexts that is part of our calling.
