        <p>&quot;Virtual&quot; <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinners may be here to stay. A <b>survey</b> of 2,004 Americans who celebrate Turkey Day explored how people are looking to spend the upcoming holiday and found more than half...  In its annual <b>survey</b>, respondents said they expected to have an average of nine people over for Thanksgiving, up from seven people last year and the highest since 2020, when the average was five...  From Rachael Ray&#39;s one-pan <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> to Ina Garten&#39;s green beans, here&#39;s what <b>celebrity</b> chef&#39;s think you should <b>cook</b> for a solo <b>dinner</b>.  According to the <b>survey</b>, which polled over 3,400 Americans, the top dish that guests look forward to each year is none other than the star of the show: the turkey or &mdash; in some cases &mdash; the ham.  Afternoon is the most popular time for <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b>, but there&rsquo;s no consensus on early versus late afternoon. Some 36% of Americans prefer to have <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> in the early afternoon (that is, between noon and 3 p.m.), while 38% prefer to have it in the late afternoon (between 3 and 6 p.m.).  According to the <b>survey</b>, Americans prefer to tuck into <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> in the afternoon, with 36 percent preferring to eat between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. and 38 percent preferring to eat...  The biggest &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> fail&rdquo; is not having all the food <b>cooked</b> on time &mdash; with <b>41</b> percent of Americans saying they&rsquo;ve been left hungry and waiting at dinner. There&rsquo;s nothing much worse on Thanksgiving than screwing up the turkey, but it&rsquo;s easy to do.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> stuffing (or dressing as some people call it) was favored by 44% of consumers followed by pie (32%), potatoes (27%), sweet potatoes (25%), and a tie for last place between mac and cheese and cranberry sauce (both at 18%).  Once you know how many guests to expect, choose an appropriately sized turkey (or whatever main dish you plan to serve). A good rule of thumb is <b>about </b>1.5 pounds of turkey per person. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving girlfriend poem. Excel function thanksgiving date. Stores open near me thanksgiving 2024.
