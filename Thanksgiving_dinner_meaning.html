        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner meaning Christian prayers of thanksgiving and praise</strong></h2>
        <p>In this <b>book</b> <b>Barbara</b> <b>Rainey</b> has provided Christian families with a unique rendition of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> story. Written for the whole family, the core of the story is given in large text for reading aloud, with more details for adults and teens added in smaller font and sidebars.  For the <b>Rainey</b> family, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was not going to be just eating, hours of TV, naps, and leftover turkey sandwiches&mdash;followed by a stress-filled Friday of frantic Christmas shopping at the mall. With my husband&rsquo;s help, I initiated some new traditions into our <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day.  <b>Barbara</b> <b>Rainey</b> has written a beautiful <b>keepsake</b> <b>book</b> recalling the history of this great and mighty land.

Tells the story of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, discussing the origins of the Pilgrims, their voyage on the Mayflower, survival in the New World, contact with Native Americans, and the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration; and includes a CD with seven <b>Thanksgiving</b> hymns &quot;A FamilyLife <b>book</b>.&quot; Includes bibliographical references (page 60)  This <b>Thanksgiving</b> season, to help you and your family celebrate this day, I want to share the audio version of a story I wrote many years ago, <b>Thanksgiving</b>: A Time to Remember. As a history major many years ago, I loved digging into the history of this story and writing about it through a Christian lens.  A holiday for celebrating faith, family, and freedom, Thanksgiving Day is both distinctly Christian and exclusively American. <b>Barbara</b> <b>Rainey</b> has created an excellent resource for enabling you and your family to remember the past, recognize God&#39;s hand in our history, and express thankfulness to Him for His goodness today.
