        <h2><strong>Cupcake decorations for thanksgiving Best united states thanksgiving vacations</strong></h2>
        <p>Another bit of trivia is that the truly &ldquo;First Thanksgiving&rdquo; celebration occurred on American soil on April 30, <b>1598</b> in Texas when Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate declared a day of Thanksgiving to be commemorated by the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.  <b>Squanto</b>, a Wampanoag who spoke English and was an ally of the settlers, was Catholic. Abducted as a slave and taken to Europe, Squanto had his Catholic faith to help him survive his six-year journey home and bridge two different cultures.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>On</b> <b>September</b> <b>8</b>, <b>1565</b>, the feast of Our Lady&rsquo;s Nativity, Spanish Catholics sat down for their first Thanksgiving dinner in the colonial town of St. Augustine, Florida. Three things marked this event: a Catholic hero, a Mass, and a battle.  The first Thanksgiving feast was celebrated back in <b>1598</b>, in New Mexico, by Spanish-Catholic colonists and Indian converts to the Faith. They thanked the true God for bringing them safely through many troubles and dangers and for the fact that the seed of the Gospel of Christ was beginning to take root.  Some historians believe that <b>the first Thanksgiving </b>in America was a <b>Catholic </b>Mass that happened 50 years before Plymouth! Did you know that <b>the first </b>&ldquo;<b>thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; meal in <b>the </b>United States may...  The first date goes back <b>to</b> <b>May</b> <b>1541</b> when Fr. Juan de Padilla held a Thanksgiving service in Canyon, Texas. The second feast celebration happened in 1565, when the Spanish admiral Don Pedro Men&eacute;ndez de Avil&eacute;s kissed a cross held by Fr. Francisco Lopez and claimed Florida for God and his county.  This feast, which included a <b>Catholic</b> Mass, can be considered America&rsquo;s <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Reports of the event indicate that the Mass was witnessed by Indians , who watched quietly in amazement.  Julie Larsen discusses early celebrations of Thanksgiving among Catholics in the United States. I think the <b>Mass</b> is the highest form of Thanksgiving for Catholics. So, I decided to research about where the first Mass in America was celebrated. </p>        <p>Things to do on thanksgiving day phoenix. Animated thanksgiving ecards.
