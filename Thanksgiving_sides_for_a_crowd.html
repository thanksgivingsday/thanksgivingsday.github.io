        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving sides for a crowd Restaurants in pigeon forge tn that deliver</strong></h2>
        <p>Here are 10 facts about the origins of Thanksgiving. 1. The first Thanksgiving is popularly thought to have been <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>. The popular Thanksgiving tradition situates the first Thanksgiving celebration in North America in the year 1621.  Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early New England history that have been identified as the &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot;, including Pilgrim holidays in Plymouth in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in Boston in 1631.  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday?

Half of the Pilgrims died during their <b>first</b> winter in North America.  Thanksgiving pageants at schools often involved a recreation of the imagined &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; to reinforce the Pilgrim narrative and the importance of the story to an understanding of U.S. history.  The first Thanksgiving was a <b>harvest</b> celebration held by the pilgrims of <b>Plymouth</b> colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  While the settlers at Plymouth and their allies from the Wampanoag tribe really did get together in <b>1621</b> for a table-groaning, three-day feast to celebrate the settlers&#39; first harvest, that&#39;s far... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving poem for birthday. <a href="./118.html">Sports authority store hours thanksgiving</a>.
