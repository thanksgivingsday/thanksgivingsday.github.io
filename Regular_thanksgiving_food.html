        <h2><strong>Regular thanksgiving food Holiday ham and turkey</strong></h2>
        <p>In Greece, people don&rsquo;t celebrate Thanksgiving, but in ancient Greece, they celebrated &ldquo;<b>Thesmoforia</b>&rdquo;. The myth has it that when Hades, the god of the underworld, kidnapped the young girl Persephone, her mother Demeter could not feed the world and winter came over the land.  The cornerstone of <b>Thanksgiving</b> decor is the not-so-humble cornucopia: a horn whose broad opening overflows with the fruits of a bountiful harvest. Today the symbol may seem as American as, well ...  The ancient Greeks celebrated <b>thanksgiving</b> to honor Demeter, the goddess of harvest. in October. The Ancient Greeks even had a <b>thanksgiving</b> parade in mid-November, known as Maemacterion.  Thesmophoria: An Ancient <b>Greek Thanksgiving </b>Celebration For thousands of years festivals for giving thanks have been taking place in many locations around the world. In ancient Greece when the underworld god Hades abducted the young maiden Persephone, her mother Demeter wouldn&rsquo;t feed the world, and winter came upon the land.  The Attic or Athenian calendar, exclusive to the goings on of the Athenians, was only one of the many ancient <b>Greek</b> calendars. It was a festival calendar consisting of twelve months, most of them named after a festival or a god and was created solely to remind the Athenians of the more than eighty yearly celebrations, plus the more than sixty God&rsquo;s Birthdays, which were celebrated monthly ...  The modern cornucopia is typically a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket filled with festive fruit and vegetables and has become closely tied to <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was actually a celebration of the fall harvest and was a three-day festival between the Puritan Pilgrims and the Native Americans.  Thesmophoria, in <b>Greek</b> religion was an ancient festival held in honor of Demeter Thesmophoros which was celebrated by women in many parts of the <b>Greek</b> world. The meaning of the name Demeter Thesmophoros still remains unresolved, although it perhaps translates to &ldquo;bringer of treasure or wealth,&rdquo; an obsolete sense of thesmos.  What&#39;s the <b>history</b> of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> cornucopia? The word &quot;cornucopia&quot; is derived from two Latin words: cornu, meaning &quot;horn,&quot; and copia, meaning &quot;plenty.&quot; A frequent presence in <b>Greek</b> and Roman folklore, the overflowing cornucopia was often depicted as a symbolic accessory carried by gods and goddesses like Hercules, Fortuna, and Demeter.  Today Greeks in America and Canada not only celebrate the modern day &ldquo;Thesmophoria,&rdquo; but also add <b>Greek </b>flavor to the American <b>Thanksgiving </b>tradition. Ask any <b>Greek </b>and they will give you a variation on how to cook the turkey, or, you can get our version of <b>Greek </b>style Turkey. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving math free printables. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/935.html">Thanksgiving classroom moviles</a>.
