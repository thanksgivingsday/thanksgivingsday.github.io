        <h2><strong>Rite aid thanksgiving store hours Decoracion de mesa para thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony ...  &quot;Most of today&#39;s classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> dishes weren&#39;t served in 1621,&quot; says Curtin. &quot;These traditional holiday dishes became part of the menu after 1700.  So how <b>did</b> the Indians and <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>eat</b> all this <b>food</b>? Not with a fork, which hadn&rsquo;t debuted on the dining room table yet. Guests sliced off their own portions of <b>meat</b> with a knife. Spoons, wood plates, bowls, and large linen napkins were used. Napkins were also used as hot pads to handle hot meats during the early days of Plymouth.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. The <b>first</b> account is William Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip;  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal is remarkably consistent in its elements: the turkey, the stuffing, the sweet potatoes, the cranberry sauce. Barring ethical, health, or religious objections, it is pretty much the same meal for everyone, across latitudes and longitudes, and through the years of their lives.  Only 5 percent of this <b>food</b> was served <b>at</b> the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>. There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn ...  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  There&rsquo;s a good chance the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag <b>did</b> in fact <b>eat</b> turkey as part of that very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Wild turkey was a common <b>food</b> source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds. <b>Did</b> they come back with any turkey?  Artist Jennie Augusta Brownscombe painted this work, The <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> at Plymouth, in 1914.
