        <h2><strong>Is knotts berry farm open on thanksgiving Is king soopers closed on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>What <b>Wasn</b>&#39;<b>t</b> <b>Served</b> at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. It is also worth noting what was not present at the first Thanksgiving <b>feast</b>. There were no cloudlike heaps of mashed potatoes, since white potatoes had not yet crossed over from South America.  Venison: The Wampanoag brought deer to the feast, a generous offering that likely stole the spotlight.; Wildfowl: Think ducks, geese, and maybe turkey.; Seafood: Lobster, clams, and fish <b>were</b> ...  But if one were to create a historically accurate feast, consisting of only those foods that historians are certain were served at the so-called &ldquo;first Thanksgiving,&rdquo; there would be <b>slimmer</b>...  When the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag shared the first Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>turkey</b> were missing from the table.  From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  For one <b>thing</b>, <b>macaroni</b> and <b>cheese</b> is definitely not a traditional Thanksgiving food, nor did the Pilgrims and Wampanoag have oven-safe dishes for baking green-bean casseroles. Or marshmallows. So, what did the Pilgrims eat during that very first Thanksgiving? Let&rsquo;s take a deeper dive.  Although what was grown in those gardens isn&rsquo;t mentioned by name in historical documents, later sources <b>suggest</b> <b>turnips</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>onions</b> and <b>garlic</b> might have been available to cook with and eat for the first Thanksgiving meal.  Courses and sides that <b>were</b> definitely <b>not</b> on the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> table To some extent, the exercise of reimagining the spread of <b>food</b> at the 1621 celebration becomes a process of elimination.  However, many of the <b>foods</b> we associate with a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner actually weren&rsquo;t available for the <b>first</b> feast, which stretched for three days. So <b>what foods</b> <b>were</b> <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. </p>        <p><strong>Is knotts berry farm open on thanksgiving</strong>.
