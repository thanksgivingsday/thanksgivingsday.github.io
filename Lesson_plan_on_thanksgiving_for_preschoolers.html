        <p>&quot;Come,<b></b> Ye Thankful People,<b></b> Come&quot; is an English Christian <b>harvest</b> festival hymn written in 1844 by Henry Alford. [1] It is most often sung to the tune St. George&#39;s Windsor by George Job Elvey . History  The hymn &ldquo;Come, Ye Thankful People, Come&rdquo; is often sung at Christian services of thanksgiving. Written in 1844 by Henry Alford, it begins with thanks to God for crops safely gathered in before winter. But it is more than gratefulness for the bounty of the land. The hymn ends by focusing on God&rsquo;s &ldquo;<b>harvest</b>&rdquo; of His people when Christ ...  offer our praise and thanksgiving, to hear and receive God&rsquo;s holy word, to pray for the needs of the world, and to seek the forgiveness of our sins, that by the power of the Holy Spirit we may give ourselves to the service of God. Hymn 37 Come ye thankful people come 1.Come, ye thankful people, come, raise the song of <b>harvest</b>-<b>home</b>;  <b>Harvest</b> and Thanksgiving - The Church of England  In England, the writer understands this song to be sung often at the festival &quot;<b>Harvest</b> <b>Home</b>.&quot; In America, Thanksgiving is the usual occasion for the singing of this hymn which is by nature of its lyrics rather seasonal in nature. The problem: some little-used and biblical ﻿ agricultural terms.  Raise the song of <b>harvest</b> <b>home</b>. All the world is God&rsquo;s own field, Fruit unto His praise to yield; Wheat and tares together sown, Unto joy or sorrow grown; First the blade, and then the ear, Then the full corn shall appear: Lord of <b>harvest</b>, grant that we Wholesome grain and pure may be. For the Lord our God shall come, And shall take His ...  Thanksgiving begins with the most concrete blessings in our lives. As well as a physical <b>harvest</b>, the first stanza alludes to Jesus&rsquo; remark in all three synoptic gospels&mdash;the <b>harvest</b> is plentiful but the laborers are few, and the thankful people who are called to come are those who have already been sent by the Lord of the <b>harvest</b>, Jesus Christ.  An early <b>Harvest</b> Festival used to be celebrated at the beginning of the <b>Harvest</b> season on 1 August and was called Lammas, meaning &#39;loaf Mass&#39;. Farmers made loaves of bread from the fresh wheat crop. These were given to the local church as the Communion bread during a special service thanking God for the <b>harvest</b>.
