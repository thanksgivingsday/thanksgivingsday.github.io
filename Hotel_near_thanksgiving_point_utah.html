        <h2><strong>Hotel near thanksgiving point utah Thanksgiving memories essay</strong></h2>
        <p>A big, roast turkey is always the centerpiece of our Thanksgiving feast. And, back in <b>1621</b>, wild turkeys were also likely part of the first Thanksgiving, but there were also other main dishes, like deer, duck, and goose.  In 1789, <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> issued a Thanksgiving Proclamation asking all citizens to give thanks together as a country on November 26. It may be because of this first official celebration and a remark supposedly made by Alexander <b>Hamilton</b> that turkey is the traditional food for Thanksgiving.  How did <b>turkey</b> become the centerpiece of this feast? It is often assumed that today&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu originated in an event commonly referred to as the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; There is indeed evidence of a meal shared between Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth colony (in what is now Massachusetts) and Wampanoag people in late 1621.  <b>Turkey</b> Was it at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Possibly! While turkeys are not mentioned specifically in records dating back to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Edward Winslow, the author of one of the only accounts of the historic feast, mentioned that the governor sent four men to hunt fowl, and &ldquo;they four in one day killed as much fowl, as with a little help beside, served the company almost a week.&rdquo;  Turkey or no turkey, the first Thanksgiving&rsquo;s attendees almost certainly got their fill of meat. Winslow wrote that the <b>Wampanoag</b> arrived with an offering of five deer.  How did the <b>turkey</b> become a popular <b>Thanksgiving</b> centerpiece? Did the Pilgrims eat <b>turkey</b>? What about pumpkin pie? See how foods differed from today&mdash;and some historically inspired recipes, too!  Upon sitting down to a lackluster, turkey-less Thanksgiving feast at the turn of the 19th century, founding <b>father</b> <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> once remarked, &ldquo;No citizen of the U.S. shall refrain from...  <b>Turkey</b>, a <b>Thanksgiving</b> staple so ubiquitous it has become all but synonymous with the holiday, may or may not have been on offer when the Pilgrims hosted the inaugural feast in 1621.  We spoke to food historians to discover exactly when we <b>started</b> eating <b>turkey</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b> and why it has endured as a Thanksgiving tradition.
