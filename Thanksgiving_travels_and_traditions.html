        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving travels and traditions Catered thanksgiving dinner brooklyn</strong></h2>
        <p>On October 3, 1789, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November 26, 1789, as an <b>official</b> <b>holiday</b> of &quot;sincere and humble thanks.&quot; The nation then celebrated its first <b>Thanksgiving</b> under its new Constitution.  What is often overlooked in the Thanksgiving story is the woman who petitioned Congress and urged five presidents to designate a unified national Thanksgiving holiday. <b>Sarah</b> <b>Josepha</b> <b>Hale</b>, who petitioned five presidents to declare Thanksgiving an annual, national holiday.  Since Abraham Lincoln, presidents have issued a <b>Thanksgiving </b>Proclamation every year, appointing the day set by Lincoln &ndash; the &ldquo;last Thursday in November&rdquo; as the <b>official </b>day of national <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  She finally had success when in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared <b>Thanksgiving </b>a national <b>holiday </b>on the last Thursday in November. Lincoln&rsquo;s proclamation <b>urged </b>the nation <b>to </b>heal its wounds and restore &ldquo;peace, harmony, tranquility and Union.&rdquo;  On October 3, 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation designating &ldquo;the last Thursday of November next, as a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s announcement marked the culmination of a multi-decade campaign by Sarah Josepha Hale to make <b>Thanksgiving</b> into a national <b>holiday</b>.  On October 3, 1863, amid the turmoil of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation that would establish <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a national <b>holiday</b> in the United States. Lincoln&rsquo;s declaration designated November 26, 1863, as a day of &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens.&rdquo; This marked the beginning of <b>Thanksgiving</b> as an annual observance ...  For two years two days were celebrated as <b>Thanksgiving</b> - the President and part of the nation celebrated it on the second to last Thursday in November, while the rest of the country celebrated it the following week. To end the confusion, Congress decided to set a fixed-date for the <b>holiday</b>.  The House agreed to the amendment, and President Roosevelt signed the resolution on December 26, 1941, establishing the fourth Thursday in November as the federal <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>holiday</b>. The law went into effect the following year.  A campaign by <b>editor</b> <b>Sarah</b> <b>Josepha</b> <b>Hale</b> to make Thanksgiving an official federal holiday succeeded in 1863 when President Lincoln made a proclamation. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving vocabulary for esl students.
