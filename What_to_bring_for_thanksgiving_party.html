        <h2><strong>What to bring for thanksgiving party Dog brain thanksgiving special special</strong></h2>
        <p>All federal workers receive <b>Thanksgiving</b> off from work, as it&rsquo;s a federal holiday. While nonfederal employers are not required to provide <b>paid</b> holidays, the vast majority <b>do</b> offer employees...  Federal government employees <b>get</b> <b>11</b> <b>paid</b> holidays each year and Inauguration Day every four years. Private sector employers are generally not required to close for holidays or to pay overtime or holiday pay. Some states have laws that regulate employees working on holidays and holiday pay.  Employees who are required to work on a holiday receive their rate of <b>basic</b> <b>pay</b>, plus holiday premium pay, for each hour of holiday work&mdash;i.e., double or 200 percent of their rate of basic pay. (See 5 U.S.C. 5546(b) and 5 CFR 550.131(a); and, for Federal Wage System employees, 5 CFR 532.507(a).)  Payroll should be processed by <b>3:00</b> PM <b>ET</b> at least two business days in advance of your check date to guarantee timely direct deposits and delivery. Funds for the payroll will be debited one business day prior to the check date. Make sure you are processing your payroll in time for the holidays with Paycor&#39;s Holiday Paycheck Processing Calendar.  If you&#39;re struggling to put food on the table for <b>Thanksgiving</b>, we explain how to get help. We also round up the three types of Social Security benefits - and how much you can get. Plus, we explain your options if you&#39;re being asked to pay back unemployment benefits.  All non-essential federal government offices are <b>closed</b> <b>on</b> Thanksgiving Day, and all federal employees are paid even if they receive the day off. Many private-sector employees will also receive paid time off or special holiday pay on Thanksgiving Day.  For example, if your Director of Payroll usually takes additional days around <b>Thanksgiving</b>, ensure she knows she must submit payroll <b>early</b> so everyone receives their paycheck on time. 3. Hand the Payroll Burden to the Experts  While <b>it</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> <b>not</b> <b>legally</b> <b>required</b>, many employers do offer holiday pay (such as double time or time and a half) to their employees to reward and incentivize them for working on those days. Keep in mind that while holiday pay isn&rsquo;t mandatory, standard rules about overtime pay will still apply on those days&mdash;since they&rsquo;re viewed as a normal ...  However, no prior notice is required when payment will be ahead of schedule. Therefore, if your company hasn&rsquo;t sent out <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>pay</b> delay alerts, you may <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> <b>early</b>. </p>        <p>Restaurants open for thanksgiving riverside ca.
