        <p>A Historical Look at Traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Foods</b>. Many of the <b>foods</b> people <b>eat</b> at classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner today are due to the influence of Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Godey&rsquo;s Lady Book, a popular magazine in the 1800s. She&rsquo;s the one who ultimately got Lincoln to name <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a national holiday in 1863, which is why she ...  So which foods were actually eaten during the first Thanksgiving? According to Smithsonian Magazine, there are two surviving documents which state that <b>deer</b>, <b>wildfowl</b>, and <b>corn</b> (in the form <b>of</b> <b>cornbread</b> and porridge) were eaten. Read on for more fun facts about the history of Thanksgiving food.  Today, the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes any number of dishes: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.  The first Thanksgiving in 1621 was a 3-day harvest celebration hosted by the Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans in Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts. Historical records indicate that the menu likely <b>included</b> <b>corn</b>, <b>berries</b>, <b>waterfowl</b>, <b>deer</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> among other local ingredients.  So, to the question &ldquo;What did the Pilgrims eat for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; the answer is both surprising and <b>expected</b>. <b>Turkey</b> (<b>probably</b>), <b>venison</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and all of the vegetables that they had planted and harvested that <b>year</b>&mdash;<b>onions</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>spinach</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, and <b>other</b> <b>greens</b>.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was <b>eaten</b> as corn bread and porridge.  From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was <b>eaten</b> at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>probably</b> didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  The geographical landscape of Plymouth (or Plimoth Plantation as the settlers called it in 1621), was a direct link to the <b>foods</b> that were <b>eaten</b> at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Plymouth&#39;s coastal location overlooking Cape Cod Bay offered a multitude of shellfish to those who inhabited the area.  Local vegetables that likely appeared on the table <b>include</b> <b>onions</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, <b>spinach</b>, <b>cabbage</b>, <b>carrots</b> and <b>perhaps</b> <b>peas</b>. Corn, which records show was plentiful at the... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner casserole. Macys thanksgiving day parade san francisco. Vegetarian pot pie thanksgiving.
