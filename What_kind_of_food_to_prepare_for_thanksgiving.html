        <h2><strong>What kind of food to prepare for thanksgiving Cooking thanksgiving turkey in bag</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  In <b>1621</b>, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the...  What did the <b>first</b> Thanksgiving look like? The <b>first</b> Thanksgiving bore little resemblance to what we would recognize as a traditional Thanksgiving today, some four centuries later.  As the first President of the United <b>States</b>, <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> proclaimed the first nationwide thanksgiving celebration in America marking November 26, 1789, &quot;as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favours of Almighty God&quot;, [26] and calling on Americans to &quot;unite in ...  But the <b>first</b> Thanksgiving in 1621, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>On</b> <b>September</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1789</b>, just before leaving for recess, the first Federal Congress passed a resolution asking that the President of the United States recommend to the nation a day of thanksgiving.  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida. </p>        <p>Brockton thanksgiving football.
