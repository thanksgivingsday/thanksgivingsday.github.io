        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving vocabulary words 1st grade What time is macys thanksgiving day parade central time</strong></h2>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t know which emails to send on the <b>New</b> <b>Year</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> <b>Day</b>? Doubting if it&rsquo;s even important because Christmas outshines New Year in every <b>way</b>? Drop everything and read our guide with New Year email <b>ideas</b> and inspiration examples.  Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, <b>GivingTuesday</b>, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S. In 2022 and 2023, GivingTuesday raised $3.1 billion for chartitable organizations, according to estimates from GivingTuesday.  As you compose your initial <b>GivingTuesday</b> message, here are some tips and <b>email</b> best practices to keep in mind. Give them all the details: <b>GivingTuesday</b> is always held on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, but that date changes every year.  Tuesday to <b>Thursday</b> had both the highest email open rates and clicks. Sundays were the worst days for opens and clicks, followed by Sunday, and then Monday. 3 PM (UTC) is the absolute best time to send emails on every day of the week for both opens and clicks.  Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, <b>GivingTuesday</b>, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S. In 2022 and 2023,...  &ldquo;A late <b>Thanksgiving</b> leads to a big crush at the end &mdash; the Saturday, Sunday, Monday and <b>Tuesday</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> are usually very busy with <b>Thanksgiving</b> this late,&rdquo; Watterson said. Airlines did a relatively good job of handling holiday crowds last <b>year</b>, when the weather was mild in most of the country.  Tuesdays and Fridays are your optimal days for sending emails, as they consistently show higher open, conversion, and clickthrough rates. What times of <b>day</b> will your emails have the most impact? Send your emails at 2PM, 5PM, or 8PM to maximize engagement, as recipients are most active during these hours.  Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, <b>GivingTuesday</b>, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S.  For the first time, AAA&rsquo;s forecast includes the <b>Tuesday</b> before and the Monday <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> to better capture the flow of holiday travelers. This year&rsquo;s projection of nearly 80 million travelers is an increase of 1.7 million people compared to last year and 2 million more than in 2019. </p>        <p><a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/424.html">Good morning and happy thanksgiving</a>. <a href="./169.html">When thanksgiving day</a>.
