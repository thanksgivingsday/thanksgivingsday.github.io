        <p><b>In </b>1620, <b>about </b>100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed <b>in </b>modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people.  Native Americans and early settlers gave thanks together with this historic feast. On the <b>fourth</b> Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b>, people in the United States celebrate Thanksgiving, a national holiday...  The first Thanksgiving was a <b>harvest</b> celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was held in 1621. Or was it? An expert weighs in on the origin, history and <b>facts</b> behind <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>America</b>&#39;s most beloved holiday.  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  As the <b>first</b> President of the United States, George Washington proclaimed the <b>first</b> nationwide <b>thanksgiving</b> celebration in <b>America</b> marking November 26, 1789, &quot;as a day of public <b>thanksgiving</b> and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favours of Almighty God&quot;, [26] and calling on Americans to &quot;unite in ...  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  When Americans rediscovered Winslow&#39;s account in 1822, the unremarkable harvest feast of <b>1621</b> was elevated to become the &ldquo;First Thanksgiving.&rdquo; 6 By that time, American Thanksgiving practices had come to resemble that earlier feast. </p>        <p>Golden corral albuquerque thanksgiving.
