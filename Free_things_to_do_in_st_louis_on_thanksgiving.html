        <p>This southern cornbread stuffing recipe from Paula <b>Deen</b> will please even the pickiest guests. This delicious recipe uses crumbled cornbread, oven-dried white bread, celery, onion, and several more ingredients.  Preheat oven to 350&deg;. Spray a 13x9-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. In a large skillet, melt bacon drippings or butter over medium heat. Add onion and celery; cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until tender. Stir in sage, and cook for 3 minutes.  Paula <b>Deen</b> shares this southern cornbread <b>dressing</b> recipe with sausage that&rsquo;s sure to be a hit at <b>Thanksgiving</b> and beyond! With its warm, savory aroma, this cornbread <b>dressing</b> is sure to become a beloved favorite at your table.  This hearty Turkey and <b>Dressing</b> Casserole transforms two Southern <b>Thanksgiving</b> essentials into one comforting dish to enjoy all year long.  Cook sausage in a large skillet until it starts to brown. Add celery and onion and saute until transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour over bread and rice mixture. Add stock and mix well. Add salt, pepper, sage, and poultry seasoning. Mix well. Add the beaten eggs and melted butter. Mix well.  This traditional Cornbread <b>Dressing</b> is an essential dish for Southern holiday meals. Preheat oven to 350&deg;. Spray a 3&frac12;-quart baking dish with cooking spray. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender.  &quot;Paula <b>Deen</b>&#39;s recipe is a family favorite now. It&#39;s more like a true southern <b>dressing</b> though, not something you can make to stuff a turkey with but you won&#39;t care when you taste it.&quot; Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. In a large bowl, combine crumbled cornbread, dried white bread slices, and saltines; set aside.  I served Paula <b>Deen</b>&rsquo;s Southern cornbread dressing at my family&rsquo;s Thanksgiving celebration several years ago. And it was such a hit that it has since become a holiday staple. It&rsquo;s delicious, rich, and creamy with a subtle sweetness.  &quot;Great Paula <b>Deen</b> recipe that I am wanting to try very soon. The recipe comes from the foodtv.com website. Cook time is based on the pre-cooked rice and bread that has already been dried.&quot; Crumble oven-dried bread into a large bowl. Add rice and saltines.
