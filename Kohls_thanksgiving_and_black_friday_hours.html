        <h2><strong>Kohls thanksgiving and black friday hours Best cell phone deals thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Various Spanish, French Huguenot, and English explorers and settlers in North America fell to their knees and gave thanks or proclaimed special days of thanksgiving in the late <b>1500s</b> or early <b>1600s</b>. Probably the earliest of these acts of thanksgiving was that of Ponce de Leon when he landed in Florida during Easter of 1513.  Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early New England history that have been identified as the &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot;, including Pilgrim holidays in Plymouth in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in Boston in 1631.  Thanksgiving Day became an official U.S. holiday <b>in</b> <b>1863</b>, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. A traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history <b>of</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  For more than two <b>centuries</b>, days of thanksgiving were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day had its origins in a harvest festival to thank God for the bounty of the autumn harvest. Celebrated most notably in the United States but also found in many other nations, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a symbol of the love and joy people feel towards God for the grace and blessings has bestowed on them throughout the year and ...  Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests. Americans model their holiday on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared between English colonists and the Wampanoag. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving in nashville. Thanksgiving food mail order.
