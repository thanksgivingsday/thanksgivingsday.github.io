        <p><b>Squanto </b>recounts how in 1614 he was captured by <b>the </b>British, sold into slavery in Spain, <b>and </b>ultimately returned to <b>the </b>New World to become a guide <b>and </b>friend for <b>the </b>colonists &quot;This edition is only available for distribution through <b>the </b>school market&quot;--Page 4 of cover  Before Squanto was ever a part of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, he had already had a major life-changing encounter with English explorers. In 1614, an expedition led by none other than John Smith of Jamestown fame made landfall in Plymouth Harbor and tried to initiate trade with the Patuxet tribe.  According to the mythology behind the first Thanksgiving <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>, the Pilgrims met a &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; Native American named Squanto in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to plant corn, and the settlers enjoyed a hearty feast with their new native friend.  The American <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>story</b> many may be familiar with goes something like this: the English Pilgrims settle in the New World, meet a &quot;friendly&quot; Indigenous guide named Squanto who teaches...  Winslow&#39;s description of what was later celebrated as the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was quite short. He wrote that after the harvest (of Indian corn, their planting of peas were not worth gathering and their harvest of barley was &quot;indifferent&quot;), Bradford sent out four men fowling &quot;so we might after a more special manner rejoice together, after we had ...  It is the <b>story</b> of Squanto &mdash; of how he came to be in that place at that very time, and of how he came to speak fluent English &mdash; that is the most fascinating <b>story</b> behind the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In 1614, six years before the arrival of the Mayflower, Captain John Smith &mdash; the same man rescued by Pocahontas in another famous tale &mdash; led two ...  The scene is what would become known to many as the first Thanksgiving. The story of how <b>God</b> <b>rescues</b> <b>a</b> 12-year-old Indian boy sold into slavery in Europe and implants him in the middle of this pilgrim adventure is as powerful and history-changing as that of Joseph in the Old Testament.  Tells the Thanksgiving story of Squanto, <b>a</b> <b>Patuxet</b> Indian who helped the Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony to survive in their first difficult years. He is also known as <b>Tisquantum</b>. Other charcters mentioned are William Bradford, Miles Standish, Captain Thomas Hunt, and Captain Thomas Dermer.  For generations, the dominant cultural narrative of America&rsquo;s Thanksgiving holiday has told how a Native American man named Squanto showed the <b>Pilgrims</b> how to get food after they arrived on the... </p>        <p>How did thanksgiving come about in america.
