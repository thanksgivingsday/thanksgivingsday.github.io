Ultimately, though, the <b>1621</b> <b>feast</b> would hold little historical relevance to the people involved and was not considered a unique event, since &quot;both the English and Native Americans regularly held ...  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>feast</b>. They played ball games, sang, and danced.
