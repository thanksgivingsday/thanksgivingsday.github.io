        <p>Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  The <b>Mashpee</b> <b>Wampanoag</b> first encountered the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told Thanksgiving story.  What is the <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth? The myth is that friendly Indians, unidentified by tribe, welcome the Pilgrims to America, teach them how to live in this new place, sit down to dinner with them...  The colonists of the 17th century declared many days of <b>thanksgiving</b> before and after attacks on Native American villages, especially during King Philip&#39;s War (1675-1678), and this is often cited in the present day by Native American <b>tribes</b> as a reason to observe <b>Thanksgiving</b> through mourning rather than celebration.

The <b>first</b> national <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day did not invoke the Pilgrims at all. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day on the last Thursday of November, looking to reconcile a ...  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. </p>        <p>Animal crossing city folk thanksgiving turkey.
