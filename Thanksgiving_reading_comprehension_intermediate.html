        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving reading comprehension intermediate The date of first thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>As in the United States, Canada observed occasional Thanksgivings to celebrate important events such as the end of the War of <b>1812</b>.

Like its American counterpart, Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a time to express gratitude and appreciation for the bountiful harvest and blessings received throughout the year. However, Canadian Thanksgiving has unique origins and customs that set it apart.  Canadians celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second Monday in October, while <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When <b>is Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b>? In 2025, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> is Monday, October 13. Upcoming Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> Dates:  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is rooted in Indigenous values, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work.

In reality, harvest celebrations long predate European settlement in North America.

Even earlier, Indigenous Peoples had their own ...  Believe it or not, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b>, or at least the land that would become Canada, has its own history, separate from our American counterparts. Traditions of giving thanks long predate the arrival of European settlers in North America.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is <b>celebrated</b> on the fourth Thursday of November but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.). </p>        <p>Hill country austin thanksgiving.
