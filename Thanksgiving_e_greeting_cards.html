        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving e greeting cards Polk county fall break 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>So, to the question &ldquo;What did the Pilgrims eat for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; the answer is both surprising and <b>expected</b>. <b>Turkey</b> (<b>probably</b>), <b>venison</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and all of the vegetables that they had planted and harvested that year&mdash;onions, <b>carrots</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>spinach</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, and other greens.  In the fall of 1621, the English decided to celebrate their <b>first</b> harvest, but the Wampanoag weren&#39;t originally invited. ... But most of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> foods <b>they</b> ate were different from the ...  Massasoit sent some of his own men to hunt deer for <b>the </b>feast and for three days, <b>the </b>English and native men, women, and children ate together. <b>The </b>meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and...  So what foods were served at the first Thanksgiving? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and <b>pigeons</b> may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included <b>wildfowl</b>, <b>corn</b>, <b>porridge</b> and <b>venison</b>. Bettmann / Corbis  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> lasted three days and was not an annual tradition (yet). Wampanoag leader Massasoit Ousamequin was there, as was Tisquantum (whom the settlers called Squanto). Tisquantum&#39;s knowledge of the English language (he learned while enslaved in Europe), had been critical to the colonists&#39; survival.  What historical records say about what was served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these dietary staples were ...  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the Pilgrims <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  <b>What Did</b> the Pilgrims <b>Eat</b> on the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> have butter or flour necessary for making pies. </p>        <p>Who is playing football on thanksgiving 2024 college.
