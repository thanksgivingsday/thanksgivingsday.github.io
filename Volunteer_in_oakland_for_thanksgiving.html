        <p>This is the first myth: that the first Thanksgiving was dominated by the Pilgrim and not the <b>Native</b> <b>American</b>. The Native Americans even provided the bulk of the food, according to the...  how does our understanding of early <b>American</b> history look if we put conflicts between <b>Indigenous</b> and newcomers at the center of the story?  How do <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> make peace with a national holiday that romanticizes the 1621 encounter between their ancestors and English settlers, and erases the deadly conflicts that followed?  But many <b>Native </b>Americans say <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day is a reminder of the <b>slaughter </b>of millions of Indigenous people <b>and </b>the theft of their lands by outsiders. The United <b>American </b>Indians of New...  With the upcoming holiday, known by many as Thanksgiving but recognized by <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> communities as the National Day of Mourning, Peters and other Indigenous activists and scholars are...  It&rsquo;s important to know that for many Native <b>Americans</b>, Thanksgiving <b>is</b> a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.  What is the Thanksgiving myth? The myth is that friendly Indians, unidentified by tribe, welcome the Pilgrims to <b>America</b>, teach them how to live in this new place, sit down to dinner with them...  By the time the Pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts Bay, they found only one living <b>Patuxet</b> <b>Indian</b>, a man named <b>Squanto</b> who had survived slavery in England and knew their language. He taught them to grow corn and to fish and negotiated a peace treaty between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Nation.  In consequence, what started as an inspirational bit of New England folklore, soon grew into the full-fledged <b>American Thanksgiving </b>we now know. It emerged complete with stereotyped Indians <b>and </b>stereotyped Whites, incomplete history, <b>and </b>a mythical significance as our &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; </p>        <p>Open on thanksgiving portland.
