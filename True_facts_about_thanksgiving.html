        <h2><strong>True facts about thanksgiving Arthurs pbs thanksgiving day episode on you tube</strong></h2>
        <p>According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden <b>meal</b> but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well. <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Menu Fowl  <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Meal</b>. When the colonists and Native Americans sat down to feast, they probably enjoyed quite different fare than what we&rsquo;re used to seeing on our <b>Thanksgiving</b> tables today.  Traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison.  Only 5 percent of this <b>food</b> was served at the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>. There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest <b>meal</b>. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn ...  It&#39;s likely that if fruit was a <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>, it was served dried or stewed. A Moment of Peace at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Although Winslow&#39;s letter about the harvest celebration is an important historical document, what the Pilgrims ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was almost certainly less important than the relationship they hoped to ...  The <b>first Thanksgiving meal</b> in Plymouth probably had little in common with today&rsquo;s traditional holiday spread. Although turkeys were indigenous, there&rsquo;s no record of a big, roasted bird at the ...  The <b>meal</b> consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. The <b>first</b> account is William Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip;  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>meal</b> is remarkably consistent in its elements: the turkey, the stuffing, the sweet potatoes, the cranberry sauce. Barring ethical, health, or religious objections, it is pretty much the same <b>meal</b> for everyone, across latitudes and longitudes, and through the years of their lives. </p>        <p>Recipe boneless turkey breast slow cooker.
