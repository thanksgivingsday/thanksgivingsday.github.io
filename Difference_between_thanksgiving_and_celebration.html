        <h2><strong>Difference between thanksgiving and celebration The traditional thanksgiving dinner menu</strong></h2>
        <p>As a general rule, plan for <b>1</b> to <b>1&frac12;</b> <b>pounds</b> of turkey per person. You might wonder how one person can eat that much turkey, especially when plenty of Thanksgiving sides are served. But keep in mind this is not just the weight of the meat but also considers bone and cartilage.  For about every pound of <b>turkey</b>, guests will get about eight to nine ounces of meat. Here&rsquo;s what that looks like: How much <b>turkey</b>? What <b>size</b> <b>turkey</b> is best? Both fresh and frozen turkeys...  Wondering how much <b>turkey</b> per person you need to feed family and friends for the holidays? Here we share a <b>turkey</b> <b>size</b> chart that shares amount of <b>turkey</b> per person, and <b>size</b> of <b>turkey</b> needed to feed a family. Visit perduefarms.com to learn more about <b>turkey</b> <b>size</b> and order a frozen <b>turkey</b> for holiday delivery.  Find out how much <b>turkey</b> you need per person and for a Thanksgiving meal using our <b>turkey</b> <b>size</b> calculator. Get results in <b>size</b> or kilograms.  You can use this handy chart to determine the perfect size turkey for your Thanksgiving celebration. <b>Preparing</b> <b>1</b>-<b>1/4</b> <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> turkey per person may seem like a lot, but remember that this weight includes parts that you won&rsquo;t eat (like the bones).  Turkey size is important since it will determine how big of a helping each guest gets&mdash;not to mention how much will be left for Thanksgiving leftovers. Once you know the exact number of attendees, use this <b>formula</b>: <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> guests <b>x</b> <b>1.25</b>. Youll want to plan on about <b>1.25</b> <b>pounds</b> of turkey per person.  The general rule of thumb is to plan for <b>1</b> <b>1/4</b> <b>pounds</b> <b>of</b> turkey per guest, which takes into account the bones and other inedible parts of the turkey. That should be plenty especially with everyone&#39;s favorite Thanksgiving side dishes on the dinner table.  In order to have plenty of Thanksgiving turkey for dinner, with enough for leftovers and to-go plates, remember this simple rule: one <b>pound</b> of <b>turkey</b> per person. You can assume about <b>40%</b> to 50% of every turkey is bone or parts that won&#39;t be eaten. </p>        <p>How to write a notice of a thanksgiving dinner. Riddles thanksgiving.
