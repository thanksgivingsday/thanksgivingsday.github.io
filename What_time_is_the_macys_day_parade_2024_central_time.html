        <h2><strong>What time is the macys day parade 2024 central time Stores offering leftover thanksgiving carryout</strong></h2>
        <p>In German-speaking countries, Erntedankfest is often <b>celebrated</b> on the first Sunday in October, which is usually also the first Sunday following Michaelistag or Michaelmas (29 Sept.), but various locales may give thanks at different times during September and October.  Today, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is <b>celebrated</b> in many parts of <b>Germany</b>, with customs and traditions that are unique to each region. From parades and feasts to gift-giving and charity events, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has become a beloved holiday in <b>Germany</b> that brings people together to give thanks and <b>celebrate</b> the harvest season.  In <b>Germany</b>, Erntedankfest (literally translated &ldquo;thanks for the harvest festival&ldquo;) is a religious holiday, and is <b>celebrated</b> both in the Catholic and Protestant churches. The alter is decorated with sheaves of wheat, and the fruits of the harvest.  <b>In </b>its earlier forms, Erntedank was a predominantly rural ritual usually <b>celebrated </b>on the autumnal equinox <b>in </b>September. Over time, German <b>Thanksgiving </b>evolved into a Christian tradition closely associated with the Church, and it remains so today. What happens on German <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day?  <b>Thanksgiving</b> in America may be a tradition dating back to the 17th century, but in <b>Germany</b> and the rest of Europe, harvest <b>celebrations</b> have been a fixture since pagan times. We take a look at the Erntedank harvest festival and explain why it&rsquo;s sometimes considered the &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> of <b>Germany</b>&rdquo;.  The meaning of the <b>German</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Erntedank), how it differs from <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America and why it is still very important for us today!  <b>Germany</b> has its own <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>celebration</b>, called &ldquo;Erntedankfest&rdquo;, which literally translates to harvest-thanks-fest. Even though harvest festivals predate Christianity, the German <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a traditional Christian <b>celebration</b> that serves as a way for believers to thank God for the gifts of harvest.  In Germany, Thanksgiving&mdash; (&ldquo;<b>das</b> Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,Thanksgiving Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first Sunday of October (04 October 2015 this year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn all about the Harvest Festival in <b>Germany</b>, from what it&rsquo;s about to how it&rsquo;s celebrated today. Let&rsquo;s get started! 1. What is the Harvest Festival? The Harvest Festival in Germany is similar&mdash;but not identical&mdash;to Thanksgiving in the United States. </p>        <p>Liquid smoke thanksgiving turkey.
