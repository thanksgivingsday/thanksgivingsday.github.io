        <h2><strong>Where can i buy thanksgiving dinner in abington pa Baking thanksgiving stuffing</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] . Outside the <b>United</b> <b>States</b>, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  By federal law, Americans have celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November since 1942, but numerous other dates were designated in the past. It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668 ...  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  The United States celebrates Thanksgiving as a national holiday on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday in <b>November</b>. In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November 28. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b>, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  While there have been <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> before there was even a <b>United</b> <b>States</b>, the holiday&#39;s origins may hold a few surprises and some only go back a generation.  To end this confusion and to unify the country as the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in November. FDR signed the resolution on December 26, 1941 (National Archives). Today, <b>we</b> continue <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November.  In the <b>United</b> <b>States</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942. </p>        <p>Free funny happy thanksgiving clip art. Outback open thanksgiving 2024. Where can i buy thanksgiving dinner in abington pa.
