        <p>The Thanksgiving <b>Address</b> (the Oh&egrave;n:ton Karihwat&eacute;hkwen) is the central invocation for the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations &mdash; Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, <b>Onondaga</b>, Seneca, and Tuscarora). It reflects their relationship of giving thanks for life and the world around them.  The Thanksgiving Address, or &ldquo;The Words that Come Before All Else,&rdquo; is delivered in <b>Native</b> Haudenosaunee languages at both the beginning &amp; the end of social gatherings, celebrations, and council meetings; and it is recited each morning at the beginning of the school day.  This video, filmed on location at the <b>Onondaga</b> Nation School in Onondaga Nation, focuses on the purpose and uses of the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving <b>Address</b>. Representatives from the Onondaga Nation talk about the history of the Address and how the Address changes depending on who is saying it.  Representatives from the <b>Onondaga</b> Nation talk about the history of the <b>Address</b> and how the <b>Address</b> changes depending on who is saying it. This video accompanies New York State Education...  If <b>Montgomery</b> &ldquo;<b>Monty</b>&rdquo; <b>Hill</b> was asked to give a Thanksgiving Address in his Tuscarora language by grouping everyone into a single room, he guessed &ldquo;maybe less than 50 but more than 20&rdquo; would be able to really understand him.  The Thanksgiving <b>Address</b> (the Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen) is the central prayer and invocation for the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations &mdash; Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, <b>Onondaga</b>, Seneca, and Tuscarora). It reflects their relationship of giving thanks for life and the world around them.  This Haudenosaunee <b>Thanksgiving address</b>, also known as &ldquo;The words that come before all else&rdquo;, is recited at each communal gathering and encouraged at the beginning of each person&rsquo;s day. It is an invocation of gratitude which comes out of a culture in which gratitude, respect and reciprocity are at the core.  To this very day, nearly every social, cultural and political event that takes place at the <b>Onondaga </b>Nation begins and ends with the &ldquo;words that come before all others,&rdquo; that is known as the &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving Address</b>.&rdquo;  The Haudenosaunee <b>Thanksgiving Address </b>is not just for one day of the year; rather, it&rsquo;s for every day. Also called the Words that Come Before All Else, it&rsquo;s recited before any ceremony, any big conversation, and every day at the Onandaga Nation elementary school Kimmerer visited and writes about. </p>        <p>Peoria restaurants thanksgiving.
