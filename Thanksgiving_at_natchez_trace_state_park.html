        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving at natchez trace state park Whar restaurants are open thanksgiving in bisbee</strong></h2>
        <p><b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b>, observed in 2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people.  On October 3, 1789, the President proclaimed that the people of the United States observe &quot;a <b>day</b> of public thanksgiving and prayer&quot; on Thursday, the 26th of November.  Thanksgiving is a federal <b>holiday</b> in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] . Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian <b>holiday</b> of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  President George Washington was the first to issue a proclamation for the <b>holiday</b> in 1789, designating Thursday, November 26 &ldquo;for the People of the United States a <b>day</b> of public thanksgiving.&rdquo; This marked the first national celebration of the <b>holiday</b> under the new Constitution. &ldquo;A Proclamation.&rdquo;  Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal <b>holiday</b> to be observed every last Thursday of November &ndash; it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln. George Washington&rsquo;s Oct. 3, 1789, Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> Proclamation. National Archives. Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable.  Although its origins are religious, today, Thanksgiving is a largely secular <b>holiday</b>. For most Americans and Canadians, it is a <b>day</b> for coming together with family and friends to share a large meal. It is an occasion to spend time with loved ones and express gratitude for the year that has passed.  In the United States, Thanksgiving is historically a <b>day</b> to praise and thank God for our blessings and ask Him to heal the nation&#39;s wounds. It was also a national <b>day</b> of penitence to humbly repent for our sinfulness and selfishness. Thanksgiving became a national <b>holiday</b> in 1863. </p>        <p><a href="./337.html">Thanksgiving peanuts coloring</a>. Charlotte premium outlets thanksgiving 2024. Thanksgiving dinner scenes.
