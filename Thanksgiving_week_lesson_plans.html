        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving week lesson plans Thanksgiving pumpkin food</strong></h2>
        <p>But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in 1621</b>, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  Since the historic meal <b>in 1621</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> traditions have changed and evolved with American culture. From turkey and stuffing to potatoes and pies, we know what dishes to expect at our holiday tables today, but you might be surprised to learn what foods the Pilgrims and Wampanoag brought to the table and what didn&rsquo;t make the cut.  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the Pilgrims did eat turkey <b>in 1621</b>, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Nearly all of what historians have learned about one of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> comes from a single eyewitness report: a letter written in December <b>1621</b> by Edward Winslow, one of the 100 or so...  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  Two primary sources&mdash;<b>the </b>only surviving documents that reference <b>the </b>meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of <b>the </b>harvest celebration shared by <b>the </b>Pilgrims and Wampanoag <b>at </b>Plymouth Colony <b>in</b>...  By fall 1621, the Pilgrims were essentially out <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b>. Translation&mdash; no <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>. Even with sugar, the Pilgrims still wouldn&rsquo;t have used it to sauce cranberries. That&rsquo;s because the tart little berry was new to them. Native Americans made dyes out of cranberries.  What was really on the menu at the famous <b>first</b> banquet in <b>1621</b>? And which of today&rsquo;s favorites didn&rsquo;t earn a place at the table until later? Learn about the history of the first Thanksgiving...  &quot;<b>Sobaheg</b>&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag language, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first Thanksgiving meal. A traditional autumn sobaheg contains a mixture of cooked beans, corn, squash, and nuts, all seasoned with salt. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner roasted vegetables.
