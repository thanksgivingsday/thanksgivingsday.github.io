        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving turkey day out to eat restaurants Kilgore college rangerettes macys thanksgiving day parade</strong></h2>
        <p>What <b>Wasn</b>&#39;<b>t</b> <b>Served</b> at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. It is also worth noting what was not present at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>feast</b>. There were no cloudlike heaps of mashed <b>potatoes</b>, since white potatoes had not yet crossed over from South America.  When the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag shared the first Thanksgiving in 1621, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>turkey</b> were missing from the table.  But if one were to create a historically accurate feast, consisting of only those foods that historians are certain were <b>served at the </b>so-called &ldquo;<b>first Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; there would be slimmer...  However, many of the <b>foods</b> we associate with a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner actually weren&rsquo;t available for the <b>first</b> feast, which stretched for three days. So <b>what foods</b> were <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes.  <b>At</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> did the Pilgrims/Native Americans eat roasted kernels of corn or popped corn, or was there no corn <b>served</b> in that matter at all? Only two sources contain eyewitness accounts of what has become known as the &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&quot; Neither account mentions whether corn was roasted, popped, or <b>served</b> at all.  What historical records say about what was <b>served</b> <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these dietary staples were ...  The Pilgrims and Wampanoag tribe members enjoyed squash <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621 in Plymouth colony. The Narragansett tribe called the <b>food</b> &ldquo;askutasquash,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;eaten raw,&rdquo; said Trinklein. While squash did <b>not</b> make a great <b>first</b> impression with early settlers, it eventually became a staple of colonial cuisine, he said.  For one <b>thing</b>, <b>macaroni</b> and <b>cheese</b> is definitely not a traditional Thanksgiving food, nor did the Pilgrims and Wampanoag have oven-safe dishes for baking green-bean casseroles. Or marshmallows. So, what did the Pilgrims eat during that very first Thanksgiving? Let&rsquo;s take a deeper dive.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years. </p>        <p><strong>Thanksgiving turkey day out to eat restaurants</strong>.
