        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving morning shopping Family guy direct thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Use the word &ldquo;<b>sameach</b>&rdquo; for &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; In Hebrew, &ldquo;simcha&rdquo; is the word for happiness and &ldquo;sameach&rdquo; is the adjective form. The word is pronounced &ldquo;sah-MEY-akh,&rdquo; using a hard &ldquo;k&rdquo; sound from the back of the throat. Say it after you say &ldquo;chag.&rdquo;  We know that bringing a <b>thanksgiving</b> offering is not obligatory; it is a voluntary heartfelt gesture. The priests and the courts could never demand that someone bring a todah. How can Rashi then imply that specific cases require one to offer an animal as evidence of his thanks?  Isn&rsquo;t the Jewish day jam-packed with &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;s? The first words we utter when waking in the morning express our thanks to <b>G</b>‑<b>d</b> for returning our souls to our bodies. Thrice daily during the course of prayer, we thank G‑d for everything imaginable.  When two Jews meet each other on holidays or even in the days prior, it is customary to wish each other a good, happy holiday. But what to say? Here are your options: The traditional Ashkanazi greeting is &ldquo;<b>Gut</b> <b>yom</b> <b>tov</b>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yom tov, &rdquo; which literally means &ldquo;good day&rdquo; in Hebrew, denotes a holiday.  Etymologically, this is actually implied by the word modeh. Usually translated as &ldquo;thanks,&rdquo; the word is related to the <b>Hebrew</b> word for confession: viddui.To give thanks is really to admit ...  For her family, <b>Thanksgiving</b> always starts with a prayer. I&rsquo;ll be joining my in-laws for Thanksgiving this year, and they&rsquo;ve asked if I&rsquo;d like to share a Jewish <b>prayer</b>. I want to pick the right one; what should I say?&rdquo;  <b>Happy</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>! For many, Thanksgiving gathers us with family and friends, inviting us to reflect gratefully on our blessings. For others, Thanksgiving can be a day of quiet despair and even shame for those who don&rsquo;t feel grateful and festive. Like all holidays, Thanksgiving espouses values that resonate during the rest of the year.  As we gather around our <b>Thanksgiving</b> tables, let us remember and miss those who are not there, be grateful for those who are, and make a promise to sustain sympathy so that our celebrations will ring in the memory of the younger group throughout the years.  How Judaism makes every day <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day - opinion The <b>Jewish</b> practice of counting our blessings encourages us to recognize and appreciate the sustenance in our lives.
