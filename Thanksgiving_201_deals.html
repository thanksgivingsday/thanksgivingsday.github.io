        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving 201 deals Restaurants in gainesville ga open on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>4 <b>Cups</b> of the Passover Meal: 1 // Sanctification &ndash; I will bring you out. The first cup is the cup of Sanctification. That word, sanctification, simply means, &ldquo;Set Apart.&rdquo; This story about the Passover is the story of how the people of God were set apart, taken out of Egypt, by God to become God&rsquo;s treasure possession.  It tells the story of the first Passover under Moses (Ex. 12) and includes songs and prayers. It also includes a requirement to drink four <b>cups</b> of wine (or grape juice). The four cups are a vital part of the dinner and one of the most important aspects of the seder. They correspond to four &ldquo;I wills&rdquo; God promised the Jewish people in Exodus 6:  The <b>Cup</b> of <b>Blessing</b> refers to the practice at Jewish meals, and especially Passover (Seder), to offer a blessing to God for his gifts of bread, food, wine, and the fruit of the vine. The One Loaf teaches the essential unity of all who partake of the Lord&#39;s Supper -- a unity we have still to achieve.  Our Savior instituted the Lord&rdquo;s Supper during the Passover meal. The third cup in the meal was called &ldquo;the cup of thanksgiving.&rdquo; Some translations call it &ldquo;the cup of <b>blessing</b>.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Doxology,&rdquo; we sing these familiar words, &ldquo;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.&rdquo;  BLESSING, <b>CUP</b> OF (&tau;&omicron;̀̀ &pi;&omicron;&tau;&eta;́&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &tau;&eta;͂&sigmaf; &epsilon;&upsilon;̓&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;́&alpha;&sigmaf;). This expression is found only in 1 Corinthians 10:16, and is best understood in light of the ancient Jewish custom of concluding meals with a prayer of <b>thanksgiving</b> over a <b>cup</b> of wine, &ldquo;the <b>cup</b> of blessing.&rdquo;  The cup (or chalice in some translations) is the <b>fourth</b> <b>cup</b>, the final cup of the Passover meal. Between the giving of his body at the Last Supper as the sacrifice and one of the cups as his own blood, Jesus classifies his body as the New Passover.  In this section, we will become somewhat familiar with the following: 1. &ldquo;Kos Rishon&rdquo; &ndash; The First <b>Cup</b>. The first <b>cup</b> of wine accompanies Kiddush. The function of Kiddush is to give expression to the Sanctification of Time (not the magazine); that is, the ability of Time to be invested with holiness.  However, according to Jewish tradition it is generally believed that participants actually drank four ritual <b>cups</b> of wine during the Passover celebration in Jesus&rsquo; day commemorating the four aspects of God&rsquo;s deliverance of the Jewish people from their bondage in Egypt that are expressed in Exo 6:6-7:  The First <b>Cup</b> &ndash; The Cup of Sanctification. This is also the cup used to say the Kiddush (the prayer of sanctification and thanksgiving) repeated every Shabbat to set the day apart unto God. Luke 22:17 shows us this cup, &quot;Then he took the cup, and gave thanks.&quot; The Second Cup &ndash; The Cup of Praise or The Cup of Plagues. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving 2024 takeout nyc.
