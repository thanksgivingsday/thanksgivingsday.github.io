The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada was celebrated in the Province of Canada in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which was first observed in 1777 and established as a national day of ...
