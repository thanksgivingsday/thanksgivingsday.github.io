        <h2><strong>Places to visit during thanksgiving Thanksgiving dinner in state college pa</strong></h2>
        <p>Professional chefs recommend the <b>daytime</b>, rather than evening, as the best time to host your dinner, taking both meal preparation time and drowsiness into account. &ldquo;Normally for me, it&rsquo;s early in...  Although nearly all Americans agree that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is worth celebrating, there&rsquo;s no consensus on the right <b>time</b> <b>to eat</b>. Pew found that 36% of U.S. adults would prefer to have <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> between 12 and 3 p.m., while 38% want the food to be served between 3 and 6 p.m. Eleven percent would prefer to wait <b>to eat</b> until after 6 p.m.  Dining at, <b>say</b>, <b>7</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>., while standard on a regular night, precludes one from experiencing the vital activities that follow a feast: a genuine nap and ample time to digest before reheating...  First, planning a <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal for the front end of the day means you&rsquo;ll have more time in the day to enjoy it! If you eat the big meal at night, then you have to worry about finding something to eat for lunch (which might end up spoiling your appetite).  On <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, you may be skipping breakfast, lunch or any snacks in between to make sure you enjoy your <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> to the fullest. But, when exactly should you <b>eat</b>...  The least popular time to eat Thanksgiving dinner <b>is</b> <b>after</b> <b>6</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>. Of the poll respondents, only 9 percent (3,152) believe you should eat this meal late in the evening. On the other hand, eating Thanksgiving dinner too early is also a no-no, according to our poll results.  According to the experts, there isn&#39;t necessarily a right <b>time</b> to start digging in, but there&#39;s absolutely a wrong time. The consensus is that eating <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to when you&#39;ll go to bed...  It&rsquo;s the biggest debate in my house every year: What time should we serve Thanksgiving dinner? Typically, the biggest feast of the year <b>begins</b> <b>at</b> <b>3</b> <b>p</b>.<b>m</b>. for me.  The key is to find a <b>time</b> that balances tradition with practicality and ensures everyone enjoys the day. Whether you opt for an afternoon feast, an evening gathering, or a unique brunch, the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> to serve <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> is whenever it brings your loved ones together. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving quebec stores open.
