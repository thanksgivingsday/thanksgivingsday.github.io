        <p>A scaled-down version of my best <b>stuffing</b> recipe, Bread <b>Stuffing</b> for <b>Two</b> is scrape-the-pan-delicious, and just the right size for smaller holiday gatherings. No Thanksgiving dinner is complete with a classic <b>stuffing</b> recipe &ndash; no matter what size the gathering.  This fairly classic <b>stuffing</b> recipe has been scaled down to feed <b>two</b> (generously). Filled with buttery saut&eacute;ed shallots and plenty of herbs, it&rsquo;s rich and soft in the center, and golden and...  When it comes to classic <b>stuffing</b>, you can&#39;t go wrong with a bakery fresh loaf of French bread, sourdough, Italian bread, or herbed bread. You can also use brioche, challah, a baguette, beer bread, or even homemade croutons.  The flavor is quintessentially Thanksgiving. With butter, fresh herbs, and saut&eacute;ed onions, celery, and <b>garlic</b>, you&rsquo;ll want a bit of this classic stuffing with every bite of turkey and gravy. You can make it in advance. Thanksgiving is the biggest cooking day of the year.  Smaller Crowd Recipe: Makes enough for 2-quart baking dish. Enough for 6 people (depending upon serving size) This is our family favorite classic bread <b>stuffing</b>! It has toasted bread cubes, onion, celery, fresh herbs and savory sausage.
