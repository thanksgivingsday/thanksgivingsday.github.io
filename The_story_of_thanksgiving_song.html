        <h2><strong>The story of thanksgiving song Free religious thanksgiving wallpaper</strong></h2>
        <p>If we only take the time to say a few words of thanksgiving to God, whether for bringing the family together or for giving us the food on our plates, we can make Thanksgiving have <b>Jewish</b> meaning.  argue that over time, Thanksgiving has proven to be an especially fortuitous holiday for <b>Jews</b>, who saw its similarity to Sukkot, pointing out that the Pilgrims were greatly influenced by <b>Jewish</b> teachings in the Bible.  As <b>Jews</b>, we always look to the Torah for a deeper perspective. What light does the Torah shed on the wonderful trait of thankfulness? And then there is Thanksgiving. The day when we thank Gâ€‘d for enabling all the above&mdash;and for all else He does for us.  Chanukah was declared a <b>Jewish</b> national holiday 2178 years ago. Thanksgiving was declared a national American holiday on the last Thursday of every November by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Before then, Thanksgiving was celebrated on different dates in different states, so we won&rsquo;t count those.  While our <b>Thanksgiving </b>revolves around food, football and (Black) Fridays, what many consider <b>the </b>original <b>Thanksgiving </b>of <b>the </b>pilgrims in 1621 <b>was </b>presumably more religious in nature.  In a recent article, &ldquo;The <b>Jewish</b> Roots of Thanksgiving,&rdquo; that appeared in the B&rsquo;nai Jehudah (Overland, KS) synagogue newsletter, we read that William Bradford, Puritan separatist and Governor...  Sukkot is a Jewish autumn festival of double <b>thanksgiving </b>that begins on <b>the </b>15th day of Tishri (in September or October), five days after Yom Kippur, <b>the </b>Day of Atonement. It is one of <b>the </b>three Pilgrim Festivals of <b>the </b>Hebrew Bible. <b>The </b>festival is characterized by <b>the </b>erection of huts made of branches.  With its focus on gathering as a community, giving thanks, and being mindful, Thanksgiving is infused with central <b>Jewish</b> values. We return to these themes again and again throughout <b>Jewish</b> practice, whether in prayer services, through the study of Torah, or as the basis for mitzvot.  But among the broader American <b>Jewish</b> community, Thanksgiving is widely celebrated and even embraced as an opportunity to lean into Americanness. In the 19th century, it was not uncommon for synagogues to hold services on Thanksgiving, as was the custom for a time among American churches. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving story in the bible.
