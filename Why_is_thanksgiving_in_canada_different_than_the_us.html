        <h2><strong>Why is thanksgiving in canada different than the us Macy parade viewing</strong></h2>
        <p>Most colleges and universities recognize that there will be students <b>staying</b> <b>on</b> <b>campus</b> <b>during</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>break</b>. Therefore, they usually keep certain facilities open, such as dining halls and recreation centers.  At most schools, Thanksgiving break is <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>long</b> (the Wednesday before the holiday, Thanksgiving Day, and the Friday after) and classes resume the following Monday. Final exams are then two or three weeks after Thanksgiving break.  Thanksgiving break <b>doesn</b>&rsquo;<b>t</b> necessarily need to be as long as it is at colleges such as Carleton, but adding on as little as a day could make a huge difference for students intending to go home for Thanksgiving.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>break</b>, for many college students, is an oasis in the middle of fall semester. It&#39;s a chance to return home and recharge. You can take a break from midterms and papers. For a lot of students, it might be their first chance to get some good food and spend time with old friends.  Last day upon which May and next November degree candidates may submit an approved foreign <b>language</b> citation study plan to the Office of the Registrar. Last day to change concentration without Administrative Board approval for May and next November degree Candidates.  Check specific dates with each <b>college</b> so you don&#39;t arrive when the campus is deserted. You can call the <b>college</b> or look on its website for the academic calendar to find out when breaks, reading periods, and exam periods are scheduled. Colleges are not in session during: Thanksgiving weekend; Christmas week; Winter and spring breaks  Most colleges in the United States typically offer <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>break</b> <b>for</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which usually includes the Thursday of Thanksgiving day and the following Friday off. This gives students a four-day weekend, including Saturday and Sunday.  In college, when it comes time for Thanksgiving <b>break</b>, you get excited to finally sleep in, have no classes and eat edible food again -- or so you think. School usually likes to follow us home on Thanksgiving break.
