        <h2><strong>How long until thanksgiving and hanukkah are on the same day Albion thanksgiving tournament</strong></h2>
        <p>To end the confusion, Congress decided to set a fixed-date for the Thanksgiving holiday. <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>is</b> a <b>national</b> <b>holiday</b> in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag...  In 1870, congressional legislation officially <b>made</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> a <b>national</b> <b>holiday</b> and, in 1941, set the day as the fourth Thursday of the month. More than 160 years after Lincoln&rsquo;s proclamation, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day still fills Americans with a sense of community, love and gratitude, thanks in no small part to the determination of Sarah Hale.  Thanksgiving as a national holiday owes its origins to <b>Sarah</b> <b>Josepha</b> <b>Hale</b>, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  During the Civil War, President Abraham <b>Lincoln</b> proclaimed Thanksgiving a national holiday to honor the blessings of our country, even as he fought to preserve our Union.  To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United States entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in November. FDR signed the resolution on December 26, 1941 (<b>National</b> Archives). <b>Today</b>, we continue celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November.  President George Washington was the first to issue a proclamation for the <b>holiday</b> in 1789, designating Thursday, November 26 &ldquo;for the People of the United States a day of public <b>thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; This marked the first <b>national</b> celebration of the <b>holiday</b> under the new Constitution. &ldquo;A Proclamation.&rdquo;  This year, <b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on Thursday, Nov. 28. Like always, many Americans will gather with loved ones to count life&#39;s blessings and enjoy a meal together in honor of the annual <b>holiday</b>. If ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> may be synonymous with turkey and pie <b>today</b>, but its roots trace back to a 1621 feast between Pilgrims and the Wampanoag, who gathered to celebrate the settlers&#39; first successful harvest. </p>        <p>Kids thanksgiving desserts recipies.
