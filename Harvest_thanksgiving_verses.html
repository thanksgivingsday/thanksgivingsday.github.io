        <h2><strong>Harvest thanksgiving verses Thanksgiving day restaurant dinners near lewes de</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday <b>in</b> the United <b>States</b>, and <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2022 occurs on Thursday, November 24. ... Macy&rsquo;s announced its very first &ldquo;<b>Big</b> Christmas Parade&rdquo; two weeks ...  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&#39;t quite the sign of a new peace between the Pilgrims and Native Americans that it has been made out to be. Through the years, our understanding of the history of ...  By federal law, Americans have celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November since 1942, but numerous other dates were designated in the past. It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668 ...  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday <b>in</b> the United <b>States</b> and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  It took the Civil War&mdash;and with it the perceived need for a gesture to build national unity&mdash;for Lincoln to declare a day of <b>thanksgiving</b> for the <b>U.S</b>. in October 1863, to be celebrated the following month. The story of the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; however, is more complicated than that which is commonly taught in schools.  To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United <b>States</b> entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in November. FDR signed the resolution on December 26, 1941 (National Archives). Today, we continue celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated in the country in large part due to the nation&#39;s founding as a colony of the American Colonization Society in 1821 by former slaves and free people of color from the United <b>States</b>. However, the Liberian celebration of the holiday is notably different from the American celebration. </p>        <p><a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/768.html">Images of thanksgiving baskets</a>.
