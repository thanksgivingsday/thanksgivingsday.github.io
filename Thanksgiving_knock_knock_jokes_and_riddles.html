That <b>1920</b> <b>parade</b> (America&rsquo;s first major <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>parade</b>) featured <b>Santa</b> seated in one of a convoy of Model-T Ford (Tin Lizzy) convertibles, accompanied by 50 Gimbel Brothers employees who danced along, dressed as elves.  On <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1924, a <b>parade</b> set out from 145th Street in New York, and proceeded down the Upper West Side, all the way from Harlem to Midtown. This was the first-ever Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b>. The New York Times of November 28 described the event: &ldquo;<b>Santa</b> Claus chose <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> this year to come to town.&rdquo;  That title actually belongs to a <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>parade</b> the Gimbel Brothers Department store hosted in Philadelphia in <b>1920</b>.

The very first float at the Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b> in 1924 featured <b>Santa</b> Claus riding in a grand sleigh. The New York Times archive notes <b>Santa</b> arrived at the <b>parade</b> at 9 a.m. and hours ...  The first store-sponsored <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b> originated in Philadelphia with the Gimbel Brothers Department Store in <b>1920</b>. That first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b> in the US of any significant consequence had a procession comprised of 50 people, 15 cars, and a fireman dressed as <b>Santa</b> Claus to usher in the Christmas shopping season.  The first formal <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>parade</b>, held in Philadelphia in <b>1920</b>, marked the beginning of the holiday&rsquo;s commercialization and cemented its ties to the Christmas season. Eager for the Christmas shopping season to begin, Ellis Gimbel (1865-1950) of Gimbels Department Store organized the first <b>parade</b> to lead shoppers from City Hall to the ...
