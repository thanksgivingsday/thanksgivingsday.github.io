For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games. </p>        <p>What restaurants are open on thanksgiving day 2024 kingsland ga.
