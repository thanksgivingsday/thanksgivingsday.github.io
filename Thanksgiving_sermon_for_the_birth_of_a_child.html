        <p>Brazil: National Thanksgiving Day was established by President Gaspar Dutra, later set for the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. While it&#39;s not officially celebrated, tradition is observed by various American-origin families and Protestant Christian denominations. Australia  Although Thanksgiving is not celebrated on the same day as in the United States, which falls on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>, Brazilian families often gather together to express gratitude for the blessings they have received throughout the year.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>in Brazil</b> is commemorated on the fourth Thursday of November. &#39;Dia de Acao de Gracas&#39;, means <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> in Portugese. <b>In Brazil</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> is celebrated to express gratitude and appreciation to the Almighty for the abundant harvest throughout the <b>year</b> and for all his blessings.

It is called Dia de Acao de Gracias. The Brazilian ambassador to the U.S. saw Americans enjoying a <b>day</b> of eating delicious food and giving thanks and decided that Brazilians should do the same.  Although Thanksgiving in Brazil isn&rsquo;t a holiday, we know it for a few reasons: it&rsquo;s the day before Black <b>Friday</b> and social media often mentions it.  Much of the celebration takes place <b>on</b> <b>December</b> <b>24</b>, when family and friends get together to eat, exchange gifts, and attend midnight mass. The next day is spent relaxing and reflecting on the past year, giving thanks for blessings and togetherness.
