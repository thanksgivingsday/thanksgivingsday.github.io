        <p>This week the <b>U.S</b>. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>U</b>.<b>S</b>. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of Thanksgiving, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United <b>States</b> celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] . Outside the United <b>States</b>, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  The United <b>States</b> holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  In the United <b>States</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942. Since 1957, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day has been celebrated in Canada on the second Monday in October.  For more than two centuries, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed...  The United <b>States</b> celebrates <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a national holiday on the fourth Thursday in November. In 2024, <b>Thanksgiving</b> will be observed on Thursday, November 28. <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year.  To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United <b>States</b> entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in November. FDR signed the resolution on December 26, 1941 (National Archives).
