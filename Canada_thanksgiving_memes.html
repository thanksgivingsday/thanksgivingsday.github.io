        <h2><strong>Canada thanksgiving memes How many thanksgiving turkeys are eaten on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Turkey, corn, and pumpkin pie are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The answer might surprise you!  Artist Jennie Augusta Brownscombe painted this work, The <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> at Plymouth, in 1914. Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images Preparation and leftovers looked a little different ...  As the weather turns colder, making a hearty batch of stew is a great way to incorporate numerous seasonal ingredients in one dish &mdash; plus it feeds a crowd. &quot;Sobaheg&quot; means stew in the Wampanoag <b>language</b>, and there&#39;s a good chance it was served as part of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>meal</b>.  The <b>meal</b> consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced.

From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  Today, the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dinner</b> includes any number of dishes: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.  But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the <b>food</b> on the table.  So what <b>foods</b> were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden <b>meal</b> but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  What was the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>? Find out what was served at the very first Thanksgiving (and what wasn&#39;t) from wildfowl to produce. </p>        <p><a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/791.html">Pictures of thanksgiving dinner table</a>.
