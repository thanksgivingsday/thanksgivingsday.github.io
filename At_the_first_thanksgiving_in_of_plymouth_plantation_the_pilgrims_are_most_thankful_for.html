Thanksgiving 2024 precedes &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; and is traditionally a holiday to give thanks for the food collected at the end of the harvest season.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>.

The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> is a day for people in the US to give thanks for what they have. Families and friends get together for a meal, which traditionally includes a roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, vegetables, cranberry sauce, gravy, and pumpkin pie.  When is <b>Thanksgiving</b>?
