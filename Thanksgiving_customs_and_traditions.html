        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving customs and traditions Popularmmos thanksgiving challenge</strong></h2>
        <p>The act of thanksgiving is a way of recognizing the <b>faithfulness</b> of <b>God</b> in our lives &ndash; it is a way to consciously take time to humble ourselves before God and each other. And Scripture says those who humble themselves will one day be lifted up by God.  Enter his gates with <b>thanksgiving </b>and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name (Psalm 100:4). Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful (Colossians 4:2).

Why is thankfulness important?  Should a <b>Christian</b> celebrate holidays? How can we &ldquo;enter into His gates with thanksgiving&rdquo; (Psalm 100:4)? What does the Bible say about thankfulness/gratitude? Should Christians celebrate Halloween?  How Can We Uncover Thanksgiving&rsquo;s <b>Christian</b> <b>Meaning</b>?
