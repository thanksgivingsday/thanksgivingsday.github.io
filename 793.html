        <h2><strong>The first thanksgiving menu in 1621 Midget dressed as turkey for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>What Food Was Served at the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in 1621</b>? Turkey may have been part of the holiday meal, along with venison, shellfish and corn, but pies and potatoes were decidedly not on the <b>menu</b>  So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  So, they had a great deal to be thankful for at their <b>1621</b> harvest feast, even if the term &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was not used that <b>first</b> year. Although their exact <b>menu</b> has been lost to us, Wampanoag oral history, plus a few Costco receipts left by Pilgrims, suggest that corn, beans, and squash were central to that feast.

That&rsquo;s because the tart little berry was new to them. Native Americans made dyes out of cranberries.

For most people, enjoying <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, apple pie. But how did the Pilgrims really...  Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated <b>in 1621</b> -- ah, seems like just yesterday! Nowadays, the <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>menu</b> features wide array of items, with a handful of staples that you&rsquo;ll find on most ...  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced.
