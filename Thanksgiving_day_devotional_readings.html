        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving day devotional readings Thanksgiving photo album</strong></h2>
        <p>Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony <b>in </b>Virginia.  The legend of the American Thanksgiving holiday is said to have been based on a feast of thanksgiving in the early days of the American colonies almost 400 <b>years</b> ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how Thanksgiving became an American national holiday.  [67] At home, it is a holiday tradition in many families to <b>begin</b> the Thanksgiving dinner by saying grace (a prayer before or after a meal). [68] Before praying, it is a common practice at the dining table for &quot;each person [to] tell one specific reason they&#39;re thankful to God that <b>year</b>&quot;. [69] [70] [71]  Sarah Josepha Hale, who started championing a national Thanksgiving holiday in 1827 as the editor of Gody&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book, <b>began</b> her 17-<b>year</b> letter-writing campaign in 1846 to convince American ...  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past <b>year</b>. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional Thanksgiving feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened two <b>years</b> later in 1623.  A few <b>years</b> later, in July of 1623, the pilgrims did hold what they called a &ldquo;Thanksgiving.&rdquo; This was simply a religious day of prayer and fasting that had nothing to do with the fall harvest. Over the <b>years</b>, the names of the two events became intertwined and by the late 1600s many individual colonies and settlements, <b>began</b> holding ...  The first <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day &quot;celebration&quot; is said to have taken place <b>in </b>1621, the History Channel reports. The story, historically told from the white pilgrim&#39;s perspective, is that colonists ...  It <b>began</b> as a day of giving thanks for the blessings of the harvest and of the preceding <b>year</b>. Various similarly named harvest festival holidays occur throughout the world during autumn. Although Thanksgiving has historical roots in religious and cultural traditions, it has long been celebrated as a secular holiday as well. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving cards with words.
