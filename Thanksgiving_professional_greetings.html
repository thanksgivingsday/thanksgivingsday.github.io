        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving professional greetings Dean and deluca thanksgiving hours</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> lasted three days and was not an annual tradition (yet). Wampanoag leader Massasoit Ousamequin was there, as was Tisquantum (whom the settlers called Squanto). Tisquantum&#39;s knowledge of the English language (he learned while enslaved in Europe), had been critical to the colonists&#39; survival.  So, to the question &ldquo;What did the Pilgrims eat for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; the answer is both surprising and <b>expected</b>. <b>Turkey</b> (<b>probably</b>), <b>venison</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and all of the vegetables that they had planted and harvested that year&mdash;onions, carrots, beans, spinach, lettuce, and other greens.  What historical records say about what was served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these dietary staples were ...  So how did the <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu evolve into what it is today? Wall explains that the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday, as we know it, took root in the mid-19th century.  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  <b>What Did</b> the Pilgrims <b>Eat</b> <b>on</b> the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> have butter or flour necessary for making pies. The pilgrims hadn&rsquo;t even built their <b>first</b> oven by the time of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Massasoit sent some of his own men to hunt deer for <b>the </b>feast and for three days, <b>the </b>English and native men, women, and children ate together. <b>The </b>meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and...  In the fall of 1621, the English decided to celebrate their <b>first</b> harvest, but the Wampanoag weren&#39;t originally invited. ... But most of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> foods <b>they</b> ate were different from the ...  So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well. </p>        <p>Catered thanksgiving dinner long island.
