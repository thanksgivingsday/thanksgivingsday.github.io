        <h2><strong>49ers thanksgiving game Kids reenact the first thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving </b>is a relationship between God and man. Upon their arrival at New Plymouth, the Pilgrims composed The Mayflower Compact, which honored God. <b>Thanksgiving </b>begins with acknowledging God as faithful, earnestly giving Him thanks, in advance, for His abundant blessings.  Our <b>Thanksgiving </b>background, historically, is a celebration created due to the success of the English settlers&rsquo; or Pilgrims&rsquo; first corn harvest and their alliance with the Native Americans. For other cultures, they take <b>Thanksgiving </b>as an opportunity to thank God for the rain amidst a season of drought.  There are Christian traditions associated with the day, but the official national holiday declared <b>by</b> <b>Abraham</b> <b>Lincoln</b> is not rooted in Christianity. Instead, Thanksgiving is a secular or civic religious day that is grounded in America&rsquo;s history and used to support nationalistic ideals.  From that time forward, <b>Thanksgiving </b>has been celebrated as a day to give thanks to God for His gracious and sufficient provision. President Abraham Lincoln officially set aside the last Thursday of November, in 1863, &ldquo;as a day of <b>thanksgiving </b>and praise to our beneficent Father.&rdquo;  In the Bible the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>word</b> <b>todah</b>, originating from the Hebrew yadah, expresses our concept of thanksgiving, both the act and the meaning behind the holiday. Todah refers to the giving of thanks, including confession, hymns, praise, and other offerings.  In the New Testament, thanksgiving is the heart of the Church&rsquo;s life.

In 1816 New Hampshire and Massachusetts declared different days in November as days of Thanksgiving.  In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the spiritual roots of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. If you&rsquo;re short on time, here&rsquo;s a quick answer: The word &lsquo;<b>thanksgiving</b>&rsquo; appears in the Bible numerous times, referring to both praise and gratitude towards God.  The Origin of Thanksgiving. Where did Thanksgiving begin? Americans today model the Thanksgiving holiday on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared between English colonists and the Wampanoag Indians.
