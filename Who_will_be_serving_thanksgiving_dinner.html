        <p>The <b>Museum</b> of Natural <b>Curiosity</b> is built just for kids. Our boys love this <b>museum</b> because it is all hands-on activities. There is an entire Kids Town with places like the bank, laundromat, vets office, and more for kids to play pretend.  They are such an engaging place to take your kids to regardless their age. They also have science, dramatic play, water games, climbing place and outdoor activities.  Where is the <b>Museum</b> of Natural <b>Curiosity</b>? The museum is not by the main part of Thanksgiving Point but is back by the children&rsquo;s garden and just north of the golf course. It is located at 3605 Garden Drive Lehi UT. If you don&rsquo;t have an annual pass, plan at least 3-4 hours so you can see a lot of it.  The <b>Museum</b> of Natural <b>Curiosity</b> <b>in</b> Lehi, Utah, is an engaging museum with 400+ interactive exhibits on science and nature. It also offers outdoor gardens and a playground.

The fifth and final <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Point</b> venue, the Award-winning <b>Museum</b> of Natural <b>Curiosity</b> and accompanied High Ropes Course will open on Monday, June 15th.  In 2014, Thanksgiving Point opened the <b>Museum</b> of Natural <b>Curiosity</b>, a 45,000 square foot building built for families to explore. Inside is 400 interactive exhibits, including four main galleries&mdash;Rainforest, Water Works, Kidopolis, and the Discovery Garden.  In Rainforest, explore the ancient ruins and chambers, crawl inside the 45-foot-tall monkey head, and pretend to fly the Piper Cub.
