From parades and feasts to gift-giving and charity events, <b>Thanksgiving </b>has become a beloved holiday in Germany that brings people together to give thanks and celebrate the harvest season.  The twist of Thanksgiving in some European countries is the following: they express gratitude for the general harvest that feeds people through the winter season.

From Canada to <b>Europe</b> and more, many countries&mdash;11, by our count&mdash;celebrate their own version of Thanksgiving at different times of the year. Each Thanksgiving has a different origin and meaning,...  Thanksgiving in America may be a tradition dating back to the 17th century, but in Germany and the rest of <b>Europe</b>, harvest celebrations have been a fixture since pagan times.
