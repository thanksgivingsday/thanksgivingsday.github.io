At St George&#39;s Cricket Club, Princeton met Yale in what is believed to be the first college <b>football</b> <b>game</b> ever played on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Yale defeated Princeton two goals to none. &quot;<b>Football</b>&quot; was less than a decade old in <b>1876</b>, with the style of play more closely resembling rugby, and neither team had an official coach.  The first football game on Thanksgiving <b>was</b> <b>Yale</b> <b>2</b>, Princeton 0, in Hoboken on November 30, 1876. Public information is sparse, but Princeton&rsquo;s student newspaper thought it was fishy that the referee was &ldquo;a Yale man.&rdquo; They played 11 more times on Thanksgiving, all before 1900.
