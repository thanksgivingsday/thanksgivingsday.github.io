        <p>Thanksgiving is nationally recognized on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. But the holiday has moved multiple times throughout its history.  For more than two centuries, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> were <b>celebrated</b> by individual colonies and states. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln...  Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> in the US, and second Monday of October in Canada. On the fourth Thursday of November every year, Americans across the United States assemble to celebrate a state holiday that is marked by feasting, watching football, and parades.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in <b>November</b>, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  <b>Thanksgiving</b>, a holiday <b>celebrated</b> annually in the United States of <b>America</b> on the fourth Thursday in November of each year, celebrates the harvest and other blessings of the past year. The first documented <b>thanksgiving</b> ever to take place was conducted by Spanish and French invaders on Native land in the 16th century.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  It is believed that <b>America</b>&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668, the holiday was <b>celebrated</b> on November 25, but that lasted <b>only</b> a few years. </p>        <p><b>Single page thanksgiving messages</b>.
