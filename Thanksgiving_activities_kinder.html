        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving activities kinder Funny thanksgiving video snl</strong></h2>
        <p>&ldquo;For the English, before and after every meal there was a <b>prayer</b> of <b>thanksgiving</b>. For something on this scale, celebrating a successful harvest, there definitely would have been moments of...  The date of Thanksgiving was probably set by Lincoln to somewhat correlate with the anchoring of the Mayflower at Cape Cod, which occurred on November <b>21</b>, <b>1620</b> (by our modern Gregorian calendar--it was November 11 to the Pilgrims who used the Julian calendar).  That first formal declaration was three years after their arrival, when practices and habits had begun to solidify. However, the very first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was in 1621, most likely in November, a year after their arrival.  The <b>religious</b> day of <b>thanksgiving</b> and the harvest festival evolved into a single event: a yearly <b>Thanksgiving</b>, proclaimed by individual governors for a Thursday in November. The custom of an annual Thanksgiving celebrating abundance and family spread across America.  There are 2 (and only 2) primary sources for the events of autumn <b>1621 </b>in Plymouth: Edward Winslow writing in Mourt&#39;s Relation and William Bradford writing in Of Plymouth Plantation  The celebration we now popularly regard as the &ldquo;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was the Pilgrims&rsquo; three-day feast celebrated in early November of 1621 (although a day of thanks in America was observed in Virginia at Cape Henry in 1607).  The following letter was sent by Edward Winslow from Plymouth Plantation to George Morton Dec. <b>1621</b>. It recounts the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  The feast celebrated by the pilgrims in 1621 was never actually called &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; by the colonists. It was simply a harvest celebration. A few years later, in July of 1623, the pilgrims did hold what they called a &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; This was simply a religious day of <b>prayer</b> and fasting that had nothing to do with the fall harvest.  Conflicting interpretations of the 1621 <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration may make us wonder whether it is reasonable to draw spiritual lessons from the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.
