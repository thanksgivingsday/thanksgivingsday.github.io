        <h2><strong>How to keep thanksgiving turkey warm Macys thanksgiving day parade sponsors 2024</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States is synonymous with food and family. Many Americans look forward to indulging in family recipes and reconnecting with loved ones on the fourth Thursday in November. However, this American tradition is not as old as you may think. <b>Thanksgiving</b> did not become a national holiday until 1863. Why 1863? The American Civil <b>War</b> was raging, and President Abraham Lincoln ...  <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b>, leader of the revolutionary forces in the American Revolutionary War, proclaimed a Thanksgiving in December 1777 as a victory celebration honoring the defeat of the British at Saratoga.  As the nation was enduring its great Civil <b>War</b>, Abraham Lincoln believed that giving thanks for our nation was in order. He went on to write: &ldquo;Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal ...  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  The colonists of the 17th century declared many days of <b>thanksgiving</b> before and after attacks on Native American villages, especially during King Philip&#39;s <b>War</b> (1675-1678), and this is often cited in the present day by Native American tribes as a reason to observe <b>Thanksgiving</b> through mourning rather than celebration. Prior to the 19th century ...  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, President Lincoln issued a proclamation designating &ldquo;the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving.&rdquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s announcement marked the culmination of a multi-decade campaign by Sarah Josepha Hale to make Thanksgiving into a national holiday.  The federal Thanksgiving holiday has its roots in one of the country&rsquo;s bitterest moments of division&mdash;the Civil <b>War</b>. <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, President Abraham Lincoln issued this Thanksgiving Day proclamation to help unite a war-weary nation.  The History of <b>Thanksgiving</b> Is Complex Among Cultures. Looking at the history behind <b>Thanksgiving</b> includes looking at the full picture. From the Pilgrims, to the Civil <b>War</b>, to the conflicts involving Natives, and even how these narratives shape current celebrations.  It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil <b>War</b>, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day to be held each November. But the holiday is not without controversy. </p>        <p><a href="./257.html">Native american names for thanksgiving feast</a>. What to do in ottawa on thanksgiving monday.
