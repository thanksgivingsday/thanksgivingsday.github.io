        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving u.s Hinduism thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> lasted three days and was not an annual tradition (yet). Wampanoag leader Massasoit Ousamequin was there, as was Tisquantum (whom the settlers called Squanto). Tisquantum&#39;s knowledge of the English language (he learned while enslaved in Europe), had been critical to the colonists&#39; survival.  In the fall of 1621, the English decided to celebrate their <b>first</b> harvest, but the Wampanoag weren&#39;t originally invited. ... But most of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> foods <b>they</b> ate were different from the ...  What historical records say about what was served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these dietary staples were ...  Massasoit sent some of his own men to hunt deer for <b>the </b>feast and for three days, <b>the </b>English and native men, women, and children ate together. <b>The </b>meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and...  <b>Turkey</b>, corn, and pumpkin <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  Venison: <b>The </b>Wampanoag brought deer to <b>the </b>feast, a generous offering that likely stole <b>the </b>spotlight.; Wildfowl: Think ducks, geese, and maybe turkey.; Seafood: Lobster, clams, and fish were ...  So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  So how <b>did</b> the <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu evolve into what it is today? Wall explains that the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday, as we know it, took root in the mid-19th century.  <b>What Did</b> the Pilgrims <b>Eat</b> on the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Many dishes served during modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals were not present at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have potatoes, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> have butter or flour necessary for making pies. </p>        <p>Elk grove ca restaurants open on thanksgiving.
