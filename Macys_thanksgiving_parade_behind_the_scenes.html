        <p>Thanksgiving in German Europe has a long tradition, but one that is different in many ways from that in North America. First of all, the Germanic Erntedankfest (&quot;harvest festival of <b>thanks</b>&quot;) is primarily a rural and a religious celebration.  On the Harvest Festival, Germany comes alive with a variety of <b>Thanksgiving</b> parades. These parades feature floats decked out with flowers and motifs that resemble situations related to the harvest. In addition, participants carry a large crown designed for the parade, signifying gratitude.  <b>In Germany</b>, Erntedankfest (literally translated &ldquo;thanks for the harvest festival&ldquo;) <b>is </b>a religious holiday, and <b>is </b>celebrated both <b>in </b>the Catholic and Protestant churches. The alter <b>is </b>decorated with sheaves of wheat, and the fruits of the harvest.  Eager to learn more about <b>Thanksgiving In Germany</b>?
