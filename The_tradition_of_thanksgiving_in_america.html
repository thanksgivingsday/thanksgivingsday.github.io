        <h2><strong>The tradition of thanksgiving in america Harvest moon gba thanksgiving festival</strong></h2>
        <p>In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains. I thank You, Lord, that I am placed so well, That You have made my freedom so complete; That I&#39;m no slave of whistle, clock or bell, Nor weak-eyed prisoner of wall and street. Just let me live my life as I&#39;ve begun. And give me work that&#39;s open to the sky; Make me <b>a </b>pardner of the wind and sun,  The speaker&#39;s <b>prayer</b> is for guidance and <b>integrity</b>, to be true to his values and to the vastness of his surroundings. The poem reflects the rugged individualism and connection to nature prevalent in the American West during the early 20th century.  Here is his latest work for Thanksgiving 2013: A Cowboy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving <b>Prayer</b>. <b>Dear</b> <b>Lord</b>, The sun is risin&rsquo; on this cold November morn, And I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; thanks to you that I was born, In a land, and on the land where I am free to say, That I can live my life out here, and live the cowboy way.  <b>Thanks</b> for the blessings that abound. From the cowboy&rsquo;s life I live. I thank You for the summer rain, And sunny winter days. For rolling fields of golden grain, And for these cows that graze. On hillsides in the morning sun. While their calves sleep in the shade. I thank you, Lord, you let me be one. To live in this wonder you have made.  A Cowboy&rsquo;s Prayer (Written for Mother) Oh <b>Lord</b>, I&rsquo;ve never lived where churches grow. I love creation better as it stood That day You finished it so long ago And looked upon Your work and called it good.  Find answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaning. Who wrote &ldquo;A <b>Cowboy</b>&#39;s <b>Prayer</b>&rdquo; by Charles Badger Clark? Oh Lord, I&#39;ve never lived where churches grow. /...  &quot;A <b>Cowboy</b>&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Prayer</b>&quot; expresses humble thanks that a hard-working cowboy gives at the end of another long, difficult, and truly blessed year.  So Lord, on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, as we take a break from our chores, We thank you for this year&#39;s blessings, and for what you have in store. &quot;A <b>Cowboy</b>&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving Prayer</b>&quot; Steve Lucas  A <b>Cowboy</b>&#39;s <b>Prayer</b> (Written for Mother) Oh Lord, I&#39;ve never lived where churches grow. I love creation better as it stood That day You finished it so long ago And looked upon Your work and called it good. I know that others find You in the light That&#39;s sifted down through tinted window panes, </p>        <p><a href="./912.html">Sweet potato souffle neelys thanksgiving</a>.
