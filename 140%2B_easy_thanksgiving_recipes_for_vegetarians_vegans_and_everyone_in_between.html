        <p>This make <b>ahead</b> <b>gravy</b> recipe is perfect for Christmas. <b>Slow</b> cooking this make-<b>ahead</b> <b>gravy</b> is a really convenient and time-saving method too, because it can be left alone to do its thing, and then stored for later for big results and little effort. I love to make a batch of <b>gravy</b> when I have a big meal coming up like Christmas or if I&rsquo;m ...  Shred the <b>turkey</b> by hand or in a stand mixer. Using a mixer only takes about 20-30 seconds with the paddle attachment. To make <b>ahead</b>, make the recipe as written and then let it cool and store in an airtight container in the fridge.
