        <h2><strong>Kid friendly thanksgiving menu An example of a thanksgiving metaphor</strong></h2>
        <p>The first Thanksgiving celebrated by European settlers in North America took place <b>in</b> <b>1578</b> in what is now Nunavut. The settlers ate a meal to celebrate and give thanks for their safe arrival after their trip across the ocean.  Though Canada does have a first Thanksgiving story analogous to the U.S. story of the feast at Plymouth in <b>1621</b> &mdash; it involves the pirate/explorer Martin Frobisher giving thanks in 1578 for a safe...  Many of the trappings of Canadian Thanksgiving are similar to those of its U.S. counterpart, but the Canadian tradition belongs to the <b>16th</b> <b>century</b>, more than four decades before the historic...  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of Thanksgiving and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating <b>on</b> <b>October</b> <b>14</b> <b>th</b>. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  According to some historians, the earliest celebration in Canada is attributed <b>to</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b>, an English privateer, who, in 1578, participated in a feast of thanksgiving with his crew in present-day Nunavut (Newfoundland) to celebrate their safe passage to the New World.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual <b>Canadian</b> holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  So it may surprise some to learn that, although America feels proprietary about Thanksgiving, Canadian Thanksgiving was actually first. The first Thanksgiving in Canada has been credited to English explorer Martin Frobisher. According to historical records, he celebrated <b>in</b> 1578 in what we now know as Newfoundland.  Canadian Thanksgiving is rooted <b>in</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>values</b>, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies.  English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew had the first Canadian Thanksgiving <b>in</b> <b>1578</b>. As the story goes, in 1578, English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew gave thanks and communion was observed, either on land at Frobisher Bay, in present day Nunavut, or onboard a ship anchored there. </p>        <p>Starbucks thanksgiving day open. 8th grade thanksgiving readings. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/396.html">Burned thanksgiving dinner</a>.
