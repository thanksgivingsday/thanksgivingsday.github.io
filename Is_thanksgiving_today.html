It is often assumed that today&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu originated in an event commonly referred to as the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; There is indeed evidence of a meal shared between Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth colony (in what is now Massachusetts) and Wampanoag people in late 1621.  &quot;<b>Why</b> do <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>?&quot; is a question many of us ask amid the fixings and trimmings. <b>Turkey</b> wasn&rsquo;t always at the heart of the holiday table. <b>We</b> tapped an expert to help explain how <b>turkey</b> became inextricably associated with <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and here&#39;s what <b>we</b> found out.

Winslow wrote that the Wampanoag arrived with an offering of five deer.  <b>Why</b> exactly the <b>Turkey</b> has been the star of &ldquo;<b>Turkey</b> Day&rdquo; since at least the mid-19th century is a matter of much debate, particularly given the consensus amongst historians that the Pilgrims...  We spoke to food historians to discover exactly when we started <b>eating</b> <b>turkey</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b> and why it has endured as a Thanksgiving tradition. Plus, we got some information on the latest...  How did the <b>turkey</b> become a popular <b>Thanksgiving</b> centerpiece? Did the Pilgrims <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b>? What about pumpkin pie?
