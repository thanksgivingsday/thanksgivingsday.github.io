        <h2><strong>What country is thanksgiving celebrated in Thanksgiving songs school</strong></h2>
        <p>As decreased by the Catholic church in 1972, in German-speaking countries the Erntedankfest is celebrated on the first <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b>, which is usually also the first Sunday following Michaelistag or Michaelmas (29 Sept.)  In German-speaking countries, Erntedankfest is often celebrated on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b>, which is usually also the first Sunday following Michaelistag or Michaelmas (29 Sept.), but various locales may give thanks at different times during September and October.  The most popular Thanksgiving event in Germany is the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade in Berlin, which takes place on the first <b>Saturday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. This parade attracts thousands of spectators each year, who come to see the colorful floats, marching bands, and dance troupes.  Unlike the American Thanksgiving, which almost always falls on the fourth Thursday of November, there is no one fixed date for Erntedankfeste. Depending on the region, harvest festivals in Germany usually take place in <b>September</b> or <b>October</b>, most commonly on the first Sunday in October.  Per the recommendation of the German Catholic Church, German Thanksgiving Day is typically observed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b>. But the exact date of festivities varies from region to region. For example, the Swiss and Austrians usually celebrate in mid-September.  Each year, the Harvest Festival takes place on the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>, and very often right after the German grape harvest festival (better known as Oktoberfest). For your convenience, here&rsquo;s a list of this holiday&rsquo;s date for the next ten years.  While there are some slight differences in the exact date of Erntedank, celebrations, church services, and parades are usually held the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. Erntedank still pays tribute to the work accomplished in Germany&rsquo;s fields and gardens.  In Germany, Thanksgiving&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,Thanksgiving Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b> (<b>04</b> <b>October</b> <b>2015</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b>), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  Unlike in the US, where Thanksgiving is a fixed date, Germans rather perceive it as a period that spreads over several weeks. The final date is usually the <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> in <b>October</b> but it differs by region (and even church). </p>        <p>Franklin college thanksgiving break.
