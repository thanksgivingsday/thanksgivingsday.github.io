        <p>Celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> - <b>Traditions</b> and Activities. <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is marked by a variety of <b>traditional</b> customs and rituals that have been passed down through generations. One such custom is the act of expressing gratitude.  These <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu ideas highlight the most well-loved recipes for <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner in the Great White North. From roasted turkey to satisfying side dishes and decadent desserts, this menu has it all!  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  In Canada, the second Monday <b>in</b> October is celebrated as Thanksgiving Day. Canadian Thanksgiving traces its roots to the old European farming custom of coming together to celebrate a plentiful harvest. The first known Thanksgiving celebration on Canadian shores was in 1578.  The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which was first observed in 1777 and established as a national day of &ldquo;public <b>thanksgiving</b> and prayer&rdquo; in 1789.  Celebrate <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> with our classic recipes, from roast turkey and mashed potatoes to pumpkin pie.  In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll explore the traditions, food, and festivities that make Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> a special occasion. <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated in <b>Canada</b> since 1578, when English explorer Martin Frobisher held a ceremony to give thanks for surviving a long journey to the Canadian Arctic.  Here is how <b>Canada</b> celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> happens a full month and a half before American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is rooted in Indigenous values, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies. However, the concept of <b>thanksgiving</b> was influenced by our American neighbours. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner game ideas. What holiday to canadians consider thanksgiving.
