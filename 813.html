        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving food also known as a dressing Rice crispy treats ideas thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Dressing</b>: <b>Dressing</b>, like stuffing, is <b>a </b>dish consisting of dried bread cubes, aromatics, and broth prepared during <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Many believe, however, that <b>dressing </b>refers to <b>a </b>stuffing-like dish that is literally not &ldquo;stuffed&rdquo; into the cavity of <b>a </b>turkey, but baked in <b>a </b>casserole dish.  What is <b>Thanksgiving dressing</b>? Unlike stuffing, <b>Thanksgiving dressing </b>is <b>a </b>little harder to define. The dish is made of similar ingredients but is often baked in <b>a </b>casserole dish instead of inside the turkey. It <b>also </b>happens to be Ree&#39;s preferred method, too.  &ldquo;Dressing&rdquo; is a side <b>dish</b>, cooked with added broth and served separately to accompany the bird. But that&rsquo;s changed: Most health experts say it is no longer considered safe to cook the dish inside...  Instead, we&#39;re referring to what we should call the <b>Thanksgiving </b>side dish made with bread, herbs, vegetables and perhaps meat. Is it stuffing or <b>dressing</b>?  When <b>Thanksgiving </b>rolls around, Americans love to dish about the essential sides that make up our holiday feast. Stuffing ranks in the No. 2 spot behind mashed potatoes <b>as </b>the most popular <b>Thanksgiving </b>side. But is stuffing the same <b>as </b>what we call &quot;<b>dressing</b>&quot; down South?  Stuffing Vs.<b> Dressing</b> . The <b>food</b> in question is a savory holiday side dish made from diced, seasoned bread prepared with other ingredients, and typically served with a roasted turkey. Some folks call it <b>dressing</b>, others call it stuffing.  While you might rotate side dishes from year to year, it&#39;s not Thanksgiving without turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing, <b>also</b> <b>known</b> as <b>dressing</b>. As a kid, I always thought stuffing and <b>dressing</b> were two different side dishes&mdash;which didn&#39;t bother me because either way it was followed by pumpkin pie.  <b>Apple</b> <b>pecan</b> <b>cornbread</b> <b>dressing</b>: This classic Thanksgiving recipe is redolent with flavors of fresh sage and marjoram. Apples pair perfectly with breakfast sausage. Get the recipe. Oyster cornbread stuffing: Using pre-shucked oysters is perfectly acceptable here, as the oysters&rsquo; liquor adds to that briny, oceanic flavor of the dressing. But ...  Stuffing (<b>also known as </b>filling or <b>dressing</b>) is an edible mixture often composed of herbs and <b>a </b>starch (such <b>as </b>bread). It fills <b>a </b>cavity in the preparation of another <b>food </b>item including poultry, seafood, and vegetables. </p>        <p>Qcm thanksgiving. Thanksgiving logic puzzle 4th grade.
