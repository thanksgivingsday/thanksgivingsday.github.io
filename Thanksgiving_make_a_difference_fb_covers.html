        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving make a difference fb covers Shift worship thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>추석</b> [Chuseok], also known as the Korean Thanksgiving holidays, is one of the most important cultural holidays in Korea, along with 설날 [Seollal; New Year&rsquo;s Day], in South Korea. It is celebrated on the 15th day (full moon) of the 8th month in the lunar calendar.  Chuseok, literally &ldquo;<b>Autumn</b> <b>eve</b>,&rdquo; is a major harvest festival and a three-day holiday in both North and South Korea. Also known as Hangawi, this Korean Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar, on the full moon.  Chuseok (추석) &ndash; otherwise known as Hangawi (한가위) by Koreans or as &ldquo;<b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; by Westerners &ndash; is one of the most significant public holidays in <b>Korea</b>, together with Seollal or the <b>Korean</b> New Year (설날).  Chuseok is commonly incorrectly translated as &quot;<b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; in American English despite the holidays being vastly different in origin and celebration. [8][9] Although most South Koreans visit their families and ancestral homes, there are festivities held at the National Folk Museum of Korea.  We are celebrating Chuseok, one of the most important holidays on the Korean calendar and known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. In this piece, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the dazzling kaleidoscope that is this extraordinary festival.  Known as <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> internationally, Chuseok is a joyful holiday for Koreans. Let&rsquo;s find out all you need to know about the Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  Chuseok (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the <b>Korean</b> calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to <b>Thanksgiving</b>, this festival is observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning.  Often referred to as &ldquo;<b>korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo;, Chuseok holds a special place in the hearts of Koreans as it represents a time for gratitude, family reunions, and honoring ancestors. In this blog post, we will explore the meaning, history, and customs associated with this cherished holiday.  Chuseok, also known as Korean Thanksgiving Day, is one of the most important and festive holidays of the year. This year, Chuseok falls <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b>, <b>September</b> <b>19th</b>, but the holiday period actually lasts for three days in total &ndash; including the day before and after Chuseok. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving fontainebleau.
