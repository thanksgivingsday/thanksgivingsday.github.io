        <h2><strong>Games pilgrims played first thanksgiving Happy thanksgiving modern</strong></h2>
        <p>While the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans did break bread together, that&#39;s not the end of the story. Here&#39;s the real story of <b>Thanksgiving</b>&#39;s history.  The first Thanksgiving was a week-long event in which the <b>Wampanoag</b> Indians came and stayed with the Pilgrims. The children of both the settlers and the Indians occupied their free time playing games.  They <b>played</b> ball <b>games</b>, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened...  Bring the story of the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> to life in your classroom! Introduce your class to the <b>first</b> harvest celebration, delve deeper into the relationships between the <b>Pilgrims</b> and the Wampanoags, and take a closer look at the historical significance of the <b>Pilgrims</b>&#39; settlement.  That was the first Thanksgiving. There is no record of an invitation to the <b>Wampanoags</b>, but <b>Massasoit</b> appeared at the feast with ninety men. They stayed for three days, and went out and bagged five deer to add venison to the menu. They played games together.  They shared their knowledge of local crops and navigation with the &quot;coat-men,&quot; as they called the English, and helped the colonists survive. This content resource provides a comparison of the Pilgrim and Wampanoag ways of life. Compare and contrast housing, clothing, food, chores, school, and <b>games</b>.  In 1620, about 100 religious <b>Pilgrims</b> left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  Included in the FREE download are directions for 4 <b>games</b> that perhaps the <b>Pilgrim</b> children <b>played</b>. These games can be played with your students in the days leading up to Thanksgiving so that they can get an idea of what life was like before TV and video <b>games</b>!  The <b>Pilgrims</b>, who celebrated the <b>first</b> <b>thanksgiving</b> in America, were fleeing religious persecution in their native England. In 1609 a group of <b>Pilgrims</b> left England for the religious freedom in Holland where they lived and prospered. </p>        <p>Happy thanksgiving backgrounds desktop.
