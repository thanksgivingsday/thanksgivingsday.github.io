We give you <b>thanks</b>, <b>O</b> <b>Lord</b>, for once again you have filled us with good things&mdash; not just bread and wine, but your very self. Now may this glimpse of your kingdom sustain us, and give us eyes to see you at work in every place, and strength to be your body in the world. As you have blessed the bread and broken it,  We give thanks for those whose earthly journey has ended and now dwell with you forever. Give us signs of your continual presence until that day when we arise in you. <b>Merciful</b> <b>God</b>, hear our prayer. Rejoicing in your Word made flesh among us, we commend these prayers to you, confident of your grace and love made known to us in  A selection of <b>prayers</b> for the season of <b>Epiphany</b> In Christianity, the <b>Epiphany</b> refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God.
