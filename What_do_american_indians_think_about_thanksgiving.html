        <h2><strong>What do american indians think about thanksgiving Thanksgiving spread</strong></h2>
        <p>Is it permissible for Muslims to celebrate Thanksgiving in America? Is it permissible to avail Black Friday sales? The answer is as follows: &ndash; Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> is a holiday celebrated primarily in the United States and Canada.  In <b>Islam</b>, thanksgiving is not only a particular religious act or service; it is the whole life. The whole life should be lived in obedience to our Ultimate Benefactor, Allah. He has been good to us and so in our thankfulness we should worship Him, obey His commands and orders.  It is said that Thanksgiving had roots in religious and cultural tradition but today Thanksgiving is primarily celebrated as a <b>secular</b> <b>holiday</b>. [1] In principle, imitating the disbelievers in any of their religious festivals (holidays) is <b>totally</b> <b>impermissible</b> and intolerable.  Greeting the non-Muslims on Christmas and other religious holidays like Thanksgiving is <b>prohibited</b> <b>by</b> consensus because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of disbelief, even if one would not accept those things for oneself.  The question of whether Muslims can celebrate Thanksgiving is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>halal</b>-or-<b>haram</b> <b>issue</b>. It largely depends on individual beliefs, interpretations, and intentions.  It is as clear as <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b>, <b>halal</b> or haram for many Muslims. Pro-Thanksgiving Muslims say you are encouraging good family relations and making special acknowledgments of thanks on the non-religious holiday. Non-participants say it is not one of the few sanctioned Islamic holidays.  1-A <b>Muslim</b> is <b>allowed</b> to <b>celebrate</b> any national occasion as long as it does not include any rituals that violate Shariah rulings. 2- So, a Muslim in America can share his family members celebrating Thanksgiving providing that he does not participate in any non-Islamic rituals or have any prohibited ( haram ) foods or drinks.  The simple <b>answer</b>: <b>Islam</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>but</b> Muslims might. Ibn&rsquo; Umar (RAA) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: &ldquo;He who imitates any people (in their actions) is considered to be one of them.&rdquo; Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban Book 16, Hadith 35.  <b>There</b> is <b>no</b> <b>religious</b> <b>problem</b> with a Muslim participating in Thanksgiving festivities in order to express thankfulness to Allah for their blessings. However, if the intention is to celebrate it as a religious holiday or to engage in actions that go against Islamic beliefs, it may become problematic. </p>        <p>List of restaurants open on thanksgiving near me.
