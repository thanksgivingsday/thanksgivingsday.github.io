        <h2><strong>Fun thanksgiving family traditions Ree drummond thanksgiving womans day</strong></h2>
        <p>This year, the annual celebration began the day after <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s official Thanksgiving Day. But the Harvesters&rsquo; Gathering is not a date on a calendar, says Gerald Gloade, a Mi&rsquo;kmaw elder and ...  Showery conditions will push into Quebec on Friday night and slide into <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Canada</b> by Saturday. Gusty winds of 60-80 km/h will accompany this disturbance as it crosses the region.  That country is <b>Canada</b>, and it celebrates Thanksgiving in October. We should too. Canadian Thanksgiving is the second Monday of October , though many people observe it over the weekend.  (*The exceptions are the <b>Atlantic</b> provinces, where the holiday is an optional day off, and Quebec, where the holiday isn&rsquo;t as popular overall.) In <b>Canada</b>, Thanksgiving is a time for families to gather and enjoy a turkey dinner while celebrating the harvest. However, unlike in the United States, relatives tend not to travel as far.  But he notes those who celebrate Thanksgiving in Quebec and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Canada</b> tend to prefer apple pie or apple crisp. &ldquo;Ontarians love their butter tarts &ndash; they&rsquo;re like mini pecan pies, ...  By this time, different regions of <b>Canada</b> celebrated Thanksgiving on different dates, often associating the day with success in military affairs. Between 1850 and 1865, Thanksgiving was observed six times &ndash; typically in response to a specific event, so the feast was periodic, rather than regularized.  The first official Thanksgiving day in <b>Canada</b> on record came after confederation on April 15 1872 to celebrate the recovery of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) from a serious illness. By 1879, Thanksgiving was declared an official Canadian national holiday, though its precise date shifted between November and October for years to come.  Thanksgiving Day in <b>Canada</b> is linked to the European tradition of harvest festivals. A common image seen at this time of year is a cornucopia, or horn, filled with seasonal fruit and vegetables. The cornucopia, which means &quot;Horn of Plenty&quot; in Latin, was a symbol of bounty and plenty in ancient Greece.  But he notes those who celebrate Thanksgiving in Quebec and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Canada</b> tend to prefer apple pie or apple crisp.
