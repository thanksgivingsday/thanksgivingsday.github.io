        <p>The resulting song wasn&rsquo;t just a hit with the kids; adults loved it so much that the lyrics to &ldquo;<b>One</b> <b>Horse</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Sleigh</b>&rdquo; were altered slightly and used for Christmas.  1. &ldquo;Jingle Bells&rdquo; was written in 1857 by James Lord Pierpont, an American songwriter and composer. The <b>song </b>was originally titled &ldquo;One Horse Open Sleigh&rdquo; and was intended to be a <b>Thanksgiving song</b>, not a Christmas <b>song</b>. 2.

It also appears that he wasn&#39;t inspired by Santa and his famous sleigh pulled by magical reindeer.  Within all the mixed messages, grateful settings, and songs of thanks, there&rsquo;s a <b>song </b>for everyone during the <b>holiday </b>season. Here&rsquo;s a look at five songs that were written specifically about...  How a beloved <b>song</b> with origins in 16th-century Europe captures both a <b>holiday</b>&rsquo;s spirit of unity and a country&rsquo;s legacy of exclusion  Although &ldquo;Jingle Bells&rdquo; is now a Yuletide staple, there is no mention of Christmas or any other <b>holiday </b>in the <b>song</b>.
