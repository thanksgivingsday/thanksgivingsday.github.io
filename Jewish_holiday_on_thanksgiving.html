        <h2><strong>Jewish holiday on thanksgiving Thanksgiving brunch 2024 honolulu</strong></h2>
        <p>In Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is a <b>sacrament</b>&mdash;and <b>sacrifice</b>&mdash;of thanksgiving and communion. We gather at Mass and Holy Communion to express gratitude to Jesus for his sacrifice on the Cross, and to offer anew that one sacrifice under the forms of bread and wine.  When Jesus instituted the Eucharist, he established it as an act of <b>thanksgiving</b>. The Words of Institution are: &ldquo;He took the bread, and giving thanks, broke it,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;He took the chalice, and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples&rdquo; (see Lk 22:19, 17 and 1 Cor 11:24).  In the celebration of the Eucharist (which means &quot;<b>thanksgiving</b>&quot;) we give praise and glory to God for this sublime gift. Why is the Eucharist not only a meal but also a sacrifice? While our sins would have made it impossible for us to share in the life of God, Jesus Christ was sent to remove this obstacle.  Eucharist, also known as Holy <b>Communion</b> or <b>Lord</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> Supper is a sanctioned ceremony of Jesus&rsquo; Last Supper with his apostles when he presented them bread saying, &ldquo;This is my body,&rdquo; and wine saying, &ldquo;This is my blood.&rdquo;  By the spirit of the Eucharist I mean the spirit of gratitude, homage and <b>thanksgiving</b> to God. Just as the Eucharist is the essential part, and one may say the centre of Catholic worship, so the spirit of the Eucharist ought to be the predominant element in our prayers.  <b>1360</b> The Eucharist is a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the <b>Father</b>, a blessing by which the Church expresses her gratitude to God for all his benefits, for all that he has accomplished through creation, redemption, and sanctification.  Eucharist (Gr. eucharistia, thanksgiving), the name given to the <b>Blessed</b> <b>Sacrament</b> of the Altar under its twofold aspect of sacrament and Sacrifice of the Mass, and in which, whether as sacrament or sacrifice, Jesus Christ is truly present under the appearances of bread and wine.  <b>1359</b> The Eucharist, the sacrament of our salvation accomplished by Christ on the cross, is also a sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for the work of creation.  &ldquo;The Eucharist is a sacrifice of <b>thanksgiving</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Father</b>, a blessing by which the Church expresses her gratitude to God for all his benefits, for all that he has accomplished&rdquo; (CCC &sect;1360).
