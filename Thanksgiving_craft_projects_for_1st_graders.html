        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving craft projects for 1st graders Special thanksgiving desserts</strong></h2>
        <p>Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the <b>second</b> Monday <b>of</b> <b>October</b> and this year the holiday falls on October 14, 2024. It&rsquo;s a time to bid farewell to summer and welcome the cooler months. The date for Thanksgiving in Canada varies but always falls in October.  Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the Canadian and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. Canadian Thanksgiving <b>is</b> in <b>October</b>&mdash;<b>and</b> on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian Thanksgiving happens a full month and a half before American Thanksgiving, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Here are six ways Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> differs from the US holiday. The date of the true first <b>Thanksgiving</b> is hotly contested. Some historians believe it occurred not in the US, but in...  It may be surprising to hear that Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is actually older than its southern counterpart&#39;s celebration. There are also some differences between how the holidays are <b>celebrated</b> across borders. Here&#39;s why Canadians <b>celebrate</b>, and how they get together to make the holiday happen. Why do Canadians <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>?  As in the United States, Canada observed occasional Thanksgivings to celebrate important events such as the end of <b>the</b> War of <b>1812</b>. And like its neighbor, Canada&rsquo;s first thanksgivings tended to...  Beginning in 1921, Thanksgiving and Armistice Day (introduced in 1919) were celebrated on the same day &mdash; the first Monday in the week <b>of</b> <b>11</b> <b>November</b>. In order to give more recognition to veterans, 11 November was set solely as Remembrance Day in 1931.  Today Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is held on the second Monday of October every year, or at least it has been since Canadian Parliament declared it so on January 31, 1957. Before this, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> had been held sporadically, often coinciding with other major events and anniversaries.  <b>Thanksgiving Day i</b>n Canada has been a holiday on the second Monday of October since 1957. It is a chance for people to give thanks for a good harvest and other fortunes in the past year. <b>Thanksgiving Day i</b>n Canada is a time for family and food.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.). </p>        <p>Grand central market thanksgiving.
