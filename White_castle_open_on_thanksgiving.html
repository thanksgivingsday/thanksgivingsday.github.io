        <h2><strong>White castle open on thanksgiving Where can i buy thanksgiving dinner to go</strong></h2>
        <p>Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early New England history that have been identified as the &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot;, including Pilgrim holidays in Plymouth in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in Boston in 1631.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Thanksgiving Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  The story of the First Thanksgiving comes from only two sources <b>initially</b>: <b>Bradford</b> <b>and</b> <b>Winslow</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>Mourt</b>&#39;<b>s</b> Relation, which gives a detailed account, and Bradford&#39;s Of Plymouth Plantation, which references the event in more general terms. Bradford writes:  Americans are told the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> took place in 1621, when the Pilgrim settlers of Plymouth, Massachusetts, invited the Wampanoag to a harvest feast. The story goes the meal invite was to thank them for their help in planting crops, and that a warm friendship budded between the two people groups.  But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  Although prayers and <b>thanks</b> were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  This year, <b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on Thursday, Nov. 28. Like always, many Americans will gather with loved ones to count life&#39;s blessings and enjoy a meal together in honor of the annual holiday. If ...  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days <b>of </b>feasting and prayer to become <b>the </b>football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today.
