        <h2><strong>Happy thanksgiving in every language Things to do on thanksgiving day in california</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag tribe members enjoyed squash at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621 in Plymouth colony. The Narragansett tribe called the food &ldquo;askutasquash,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;eaten raw,&rdquo; said Trinklein. While squash <b>did</b> <b>not</b> make a great <b>first</b> impression with early settlers, it eventually became a staple of colonial cuisine, he said.  Courses and sides that were definitely <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> table To some extent, the exercise of reimagining the spread of food at the 1621 celebration becomes a process of elimination.  (Bread, made from maize not wheat, was likely a part of the meal, but exactly how it was made is unknown.) The Pilgrims instead <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>onion</b> and <b>herbs</b>.  For one thing, <b>macaroni</b> and <b>cheese</b> is definitely not a traditional Thanksgiving food, nor did the Pilgrims and Wampanoag have oven-safe dishes for baking green-bean casseroles. Or marshmallows. So, what did the Pilgrims eat during that very first Thanksgiving? Let&rsquo;s take a deeper dive.  So what foods were served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to food historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the <b>Pilgrims</b> of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  Have you ever wondered <b>what</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>ate</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  What Did the Pilgrims Eat on the First Thanksgiving? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have <b>potatoes</b>, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  When the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag shared the first Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>turkey</b> were missing from the table. </p>        <p>Kindle fire thanksgiving sale. <a href="./215.html">Charlie brown thanksgiving rated g</a>.
