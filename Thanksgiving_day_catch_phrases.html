Forgive us for our careless attitudes to your creation, and our wasteful responses to your goodness. Help us to fulfil your first commission to tend and nurture the gift of this world, to your glory and for your name&rsquo;s sake. Amen  For the Lord our God shall come, and shall take his <b>harvest</b> home; From his field shall purge away all that doth offend, that day; Give his angels charge at last in the fire the tares to cast; But the fruitful ears to store, in the garner evermore. Then, the Church triumphant come, raise the song of <b>harvest</b>-home!  Offering <b>prayers</b> for <b>harvest</b> season can help you bring in plentiful yield and abundant crops. As you pray for blessings, remember to thank God for all He has done. Then, ask Him to guide your steps and protect your work so that you may be able to serve Him with all your heart.  Here is a <b>prayer</b> of intercession for <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day or <b>Harvest</b> celebrations, from Common Worship: Services and <b>Prayers</b> for the Church of England.  Featured on this page are <b>prayers</b> for giving <b>thanks</b> at <b>harvest</b> festivals, with beautiful Anglican, Catholic and contemporary prayers, and a short prayer for children to say. Be inspired as you plan your church harvest service, assembly or meeting!  Opening <b>Prayer</b> God of the heavens and earth we thank you for the richness of <b>harvest</b> time and for food. May the fruitfulness of this time make us thankful for your constant love and care for us. We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen  <b>God</b>, <b>giver</b> of <b>fruitfulness</b>, you bless the earth and provide for all our needs, hear our prayer. Response: Lord of the harvest, we thank you. That we may receive the gifts of the earth with thankfulness. That the earth&rsquo;s produce will be generously shared. That all people will respect the earth. That we may be generous in helping the hungry and poor.  <b>O</b> <b>ALMIGHTY</b> <b>God</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavenly</b> <b>Father</b>, we glorify thee that we are once more permitted to enjoy the fulfilment of thy gracious promise, that, while the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest shall not fail.
