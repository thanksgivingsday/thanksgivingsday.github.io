        <p>The Thanksgiving holiday wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without copious amounts of pumpkin pie, stretchy sweatpants, hot apple cider, and, of course, a cozy reading list.Whether you need a <b>book</b> for the long plane ride or something that will distract you from the chaos that&rsquo;s ensuing in the kitchen, we found the best Thanksgiving <b>books</b> that play on all our favorite holiday tropes, including hometown ...  If you&rsquo;re looking for some great reads to get into the Thanksgiving spirit, you should check out Thanksgiving mystery <b>books</b>. They&rsquo;re such a fun way to dive into charming small-town life, complete with quirky characters and lighthearted mysteries.  Here are 10 great picks for a Thanksgiving-<b>themed</b> <b>reading</b> club. I&rsquo;ve included books with themes of romance, family, and personal growth. An Old-Fashioned Thanksgiving by Louisa May Alcott is my favorite because I&rsquo;m a huge fan of classic novels with feel-good vibes.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>season has officially arrived and we are counting down the days until the holiday break when we can curl up with a gripping book and a pumpkin spice latte. From heart-warming family gatherings and budding romances to chilling discoveries, we have rounded up twelve <b>Thanksgiving </b>scenarios to keep you entertained during this holiday ...  <b>Thanksgiving </b>may look a tad different this year, and we might have to create new traditions, like sharing what we&#39;re grateful <b>for </b>as we gather round Zoom. From home-cooked desserts to virtual toasts with turkey-friendly wine, there are ways to preserve the holiday spirit.  Flip through <b>for </b>classics from Louisa May Alcott and Truman Capote, familiar dramas from Rick Moody and Ben Fountain, plus previously unpublished thoughts and letters from F. Scott Fitzgerald, who has way better ideas <b>for </b>your <b>Thanksgiving </b>feast leftovers than turkey sandwiches.  We&rsquo;ve selected a few Thanksgiving-<b>themed</b> <b>books</b>&mdash;<b>some</b> short, others more in-depth and historically accurate, and several picture books that are perfect to read aloud with toddlers, preschoolers, and elementary school-aged kids.
