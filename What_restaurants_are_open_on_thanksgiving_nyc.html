        <h2><strong>What restaurants are open on thanksgiving nyc Food that was actually eaten at the first thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>In Hebrew, the expressions are &ldquo; <b>hoda</b>&rsquo;<b>ah</b> &rdquo; and &ldquo; hakarat hatov. When the Bible beseeches us to &ldquo;give thanks to our LORD, for He is good,&rdquo; the Hebrew term used is most commonly &ldquo;hoda&rsquo;ah.&rdquo; It varies in form due to grammar (commonly, &ldquo;hodu&rdquo;), but it comes from the same root &ldquo;yadah&rdquo;.  It comes from the root <b>ה</b>.<b>ד</b>.<b>ה</b> (h.d.h) meaning acknowledgment and thanks. It&rsquo;s the same root that produces the word תּוֹדָה listen and repeat, the Hebrew way of saying thank you. Thus Israelis call the Thanksgiving holiday, חַג הַהוֹדָיָה listen and repeat &ndash; the holiday of thanksgiving.  Over time, Ladino became mixed with words from <b>Hebrew</b>, Arabic, Greek, Turkish, and French. Like Yiddish, Ladino is written using the <b>Hebrew</b> alphabet. Some common ways to say thank you in Ladino reflect this rich mix of <b>languages</b>: Grasyas, similar to the Spanish word gracias, and Mersi muncho, similar to the French word merci. 7.  The biblical <b>language</b> of thanksgiving reveals its essential role in the life of faith. The <b>Hebrew</b> words emphasize thanksgiving as a holistic act involving speech, offerings, and song, while the ...  The most frequent call for thanksgiving is worth learning in Hebrew because it is a part of many prayers and because Hebrew is considered the intimate tongue of God it may be a good idea to confess this call for thanksgiving in Hebrew: &lsquo;<b>Ho</b>&bull;<b>d&uacute;</b> <b>la</b>&bull;<b>Adon&aacute;i</b> <b>ki</b> <b>tov</b> ki <b>le</b>&bull;<b>o</b>&bull;<b>lam</b> <b>chas</b>&bull;<b>do</b>&rsquo;.  <b>תּוֹדָה</b> t&ocirc;wd&acirc;h, to-daw&#39;; from H3034; properly, an extension of the hand, i.e. (by implication) avowal, or (usually) adoration; specifically, a choir of worshippers:&mdash;confession, (sacrifice of) praise, thanks (-giving, offering).  Let&rsquo;s look at that word for Thanksgiving, it is the word <b>ha</b>-<b>todah</b> from the root word yadah. It is very closely related to yada&rsquo; which means an intimacy. It is thanksgiving that leads us to intimacy with God. If you remove the article you have todah, spelled Taw which is the letter for truth. Jesus said that He is the Truth.  There are two main words <b>in </b>the Tanakh that encompass the idea of <b>thanksgiving</b>. Hodu is the command, &ldquo;Give thanks&rdquo;. But there is also a specific word meaning <b>thanksgiving</b>. The word todah is the <b>thanksgiving </b>sacrifice you do to show how thankful you are. For example, <b>in </b>one of David&rsquo;s Psalms he wrote: Psalm 26:6-7  It turns out that thanksgiving (or giving thanks) is very Jewish. In fact, the very term Jew (Yehudi) is directly linked to the <b>Hebrew</b> word hoda&rsquo;ah, which means &ldquo;thanks.&rdquo; Here are seven classic Jewish ways to express your gratitude: 1.
