        <h2><strong>What day is gonna be thanksgiving Pilgrim thanksgiving wallpaper</strong></h2>
        <p>We can gain a better understanding of the true power of <b>thanksgiving</b>&mdash;<b>how</b> it works in the lives of Christians and how it benefits us&mdash;by looking at the apostle Paul. His epistles, or letters, account for nearly a third of the uses of the words thank, thanks, thankful and thanksgiving in Scripture.  Most verses go on to list reasons why we should thank Him, such as &ldquo;His <b>love</b> endures forever&rdquo; (Psalm 136:3), &ldquo;He is good&rdquo; (Psalm 118:29), and &ldquo;His mercy is everlasting&rdquo; (Psalm 100:5). Thanksgiving and praise always go together. We cannot adequately praise and worship God without also being thankful.  &ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but by prayer and petition, <b>with thanksgiving</b>, present your requests to God&rdquo; (Philippians 4:6). &ldquo;Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; ( Ephesians 5:19-20 ).  There are at least three purposes for the prayer of thanksgiving: 1. To give <b>honor</b> to God. This is the primary purpose of thanksgiving&mdash;to acknowledge that God is God and that He has supplied us with all we have. Psalms 100:3-4 says it well: Know that the Lord, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves;  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a pervasive and essential concept in Scripture. And although it is good to set aside a Thursday each November to cultivate a heart of <b>thanksgiving</b>, the Scriptures have more to say about giving thanks than one day a year can handle. Here are five biblical truths about <b>thanksgiving</b>. 1. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Is Trinitarian.  Thanksgiving in prayer will <b>help</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>us</b> both <b>from</b> <b>selfish</b> <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>anxiety</b>. Thanksgiving in prayer acknowledges the blessings we have received, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop there; it also gives thanks for answered prayer in the blessing of others.  We can discern at least two reasons why thanksgiving is a key element of prayer that <b>honors</b> <b>our</b> <b>Creator</b>. First, thanksgiving stands in opposition to one of our most fundamental <b>sins</b>. In Romans 1:18&ndash;32, Paul looks at fallen humanity and describes the many sins into which people have fallen.  Why Should We Come before God with Thanksgiving and Praise? As the psalm highlights, we praise God because he is <b>our</b> Rock of <b>salvation</b> (verse 1), He is the great God and King above any other god or king (verse 3), He created and possesses all creation (verses 4-5), and we are His people (verse 7).  First, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> give thanks <b>whenever</b> we <b>pray</b>. Scripture teaches us, both by illustration (cf. Eph. 1:16; Phil. 1:3-4; Col. 1:3; 1 Thess. 1:2) and by direct admonition (Phil. 4:6f; Col. 4:2), that prayer should generally be accompanied by or offered in a context of thanksgiving. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving friend image.
