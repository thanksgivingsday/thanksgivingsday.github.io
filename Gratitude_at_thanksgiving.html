        <h2><strong>Gratitude at thanksgiving Pikake terrace thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Most Americans who celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash;<b>about</b> 9 in 10, according to a 2021 poll &mdash;eat turkey with their holiday meal, perhaps alongside other favorite dishes such as mashed potatoes, green...  Why exactly the <b>Turkey </b>has been the star of &ldquo;<b>Turkey </b>Day&rdquo; since at least the mid-19th century is a matter of much debate, particularly given the consensus amongst historians that the Pilgrims...  As celebrated in the United States, the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> usually revolves around a bountiful meal. Typical dishes include bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, and, above all, turkey. How did turkey become the centerpiece of this feast?  New immigrants into the country&mdash;such as the Irish, Scottish, and Germans&mdash;also added their own traditions to the harvest celebrations. Most of the U.S. aspects of <b>Thanksgiving</b> (such as the turkey) were incorporated when United Empire Loyalists began to flee from the United States during and after the American Revolution and settled in Canada ...  The American holiday is particularly rich in legend and symbolism, and the traditional fare of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal typically includes turkey, bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberries, and pumpkin pie. With respect to vehicular travel, the holiday is often the busiest of the year, as family members gather with one another.  <b>Turkey</b>, a <b>Thanksgiving </b>staple so ubiquitous it has become all but synonymous with the holiday, may or may not have been on offer when the Pilgrims hosted the inaugural feast in 1621.  The National <b>Thanksgiving</b> Turkey Presentation is a ceremony that takes place at the White House every year shortly before <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The president of the United States is presented with a live domestic turkey by the National Turkey Federation (NTF), usually males of the Broad Breasted White variety.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> meals tend to be big feasts that celebrate the bounty of the land. They are as varied as the people in North America, but they typically feature foods that originate from the Americas, including a roast turkey with stuffing, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn (maize), and string beans (green beans).  Regardless of how turkey is cooked &ndash; whether roasted, brined, grilled, air-fried, or smoked &mdash; eating turkey fresh from the oven on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is one of the most delicious and nutrtitious ways to consume the famous bird. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving sign up sheet template.
