        <h2><strong>Meals on wheels thanksgiving volunteer 2024 Langermanns thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of Thanksgiving, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in <b>1863</b>.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days <b>of </b>feasting and prayer to become <b>the </b>football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  According to Baker, &quot;the American holiday&#39;s true origin was <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Never coupled with a Sabbath meeting, the Pilgrim observances were special days set aside during the week for thanksgiving <b>and</b> praise in response to God&#39;s providence.&quot;  <b>Thanksgiving</b>, a holiday celebrated annually in the United States of America on the fourth Thursday in November of each year, celebrates the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Origins of Thanksgiving in North America  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday&#39;s</b> history in North <b>America</b> is rooted in English traditions dating from the Protestant Reformation. It also has aspects of a harvest festival, even though the harvest in New England occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> is celebrated. [1] [2]  Thanksgiving is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of <b>November</b>. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s Thanksgiving Feast of <b>1621</b>, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North America. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>West hollywood thanksgiving volunteer.
