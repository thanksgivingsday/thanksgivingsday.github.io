        <p><b>Thanksgiving </b>Day is an annual national holiday <b>in </b>the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving </b>is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North <b>America</b>. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.

Beginning in 1668, the holiday was celebrated on November 25, but that lasted <b>only</b> a few years.  For more than two centuries, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed...  Around nine-in-ten Americans (91%) <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Large majorities in all major demographic groups observe the holiday, though some people are more likely than others to <b>do</b> so. For example, 96% of Americans ages 65 and older <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, compared with somewhat smaller shares of younger adults. Immigration status also plays a ...  In 1940 and 1941, FDR celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second to last Thursdays in November, while some opponents continued to <b>celebrate</b> it on the last Thursday. To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United States entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in ...  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November.
