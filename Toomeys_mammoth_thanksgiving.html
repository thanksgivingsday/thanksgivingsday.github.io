        <h2><strong>Toomeys mammoth thanksgiving How to entertain for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Ever wonder about <b>what the </b>Pilgrims prayed on <b>what </b>we call <b>the </b>&ldquo;<b>first Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; when they praised God for a successful harvest. <b>The </b>Pilgrims used something called <b>The </b>Book of Common <b>Prayer </b>as well as <b>the </b>Bible.  The first Thanksgiving to God in the Calvinist tradition in Plymouth Colony was actually celebrated during the summer of <b>1623</b>, when the colonists declared a Thanksgiving holiday after their crops were saved by much-needed rainfall.  Both Winslow and Bradford wrote at length about the occasion that the Pilgrims would have remembered as their first Thanksgiving Day in America. It occurred in the summer of <b>1623</b>, nearly two years after the event that we commemorate.  For three centuries, Virginia&rsquo;s first Thanksgiving was lost to history. <b>Graham</b> <b>Woodlief</b> is a direct descendant of Captain Woodlief. While he&rsquo;s known his family&rsquo;s history since being a teenager, he&rsquo;s devoted a considerable amount of energy to research since he retired in 2009.  According to the Texas Society Daughters of the American Colonists, the very first thanksgiving was observed by <b>Spanish</b> <b>explorer</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Vasquez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Coronado</b>. Accompanied by 1,500 men...  The first Thanksgiving was a <b>harvest</b> celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  In response, the Pilgrims arranged a public day of Fasting and <b>Prayer</b> to beseech God for mercy and rain and, as Pilgrim Edward Winslow expressed in his Journal, &ldquo;to humble ourselves together before the Lord.&rdquo; On an appointed day, everyone gathered together, fasted, and prayed. The next day it rained, and the crops and harvest were saved.  The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 Wampanoag tribesmen attended the &quot;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&quot; The major similarity between the <b>first</b> Jamestown settlers and the <b>first</b> Plymouth settlers was great human suffering.  The <b>first</b> official day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> was called by the American Congress after the Battle of Saratoga during the War of Independence. The 18th December 1777 was declared a national day &quot;for solemn <b>Thanksgiving</b> and praise&quot;. </p>        <p>Order thanksgiving dinner roanoke va. Holiday ham allrecipes.
