        <h2><strong>What food store is open on thanksgiving Why do we eat stuffing on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Hanukkah begins on the eve of Kislev 25 on the Hebrew calendar, which generally coincides with late November and early December. In 2021, Hanukkah runs from <b>Nov</b>. <b>28</b> <b>to</b> <b>Dec</b>. <b>6</b>.  In 2024, <b>Hanukkah</b> begins at sundown on Wednesday, December 25, and continues through Thursday, January 2, 2025. The first candle is lit on the Chanukiah (menorah) on the first night of <b>Hanukkah</b>. Note: <b>Hanukkah</b> begins and ends at sundown on the dates listed below. See Sunrise and Sunset Times for your area.  On <b>November</b> <b>28</b>, 1918, Thanksgiving was on Chanukah eve. But since it&rsquo;s still Thanksgiving until midnight, and Jewish days begin at night, that would still mean that Jewish Americans would have eaten their turkeys that Thanksgiving to the light of their first Chanukah candle. It gets more complicated.  <b>Hanukkah</b> begins with the 25th day of the third Hebrew month of Kislev and lasts for eight days. It ends with the 2nd or 3rd of Tevet, depending on whether the previous lunar month has 29 or 30 days. The festival <b>falls</b> in December in the Gregorian calendar.  Thanksgiving Day fell during Hanukkah at <b>least</b> twice <b>between</b> 1863 (when Thanksgiving was proclaimed a U.S. federal holiday by President Abraham Lincoln) and 2013: in 1888 Thanksgiving was the first day of Hanukkah, and in 1899 it was the fourth day.  In 2023, <b>Hanukkah</b> begins at sundown on Thursday, Dec. 7 and lasts <b>until</b> sundown on Friday, Dec. 15. In 2024, <b>Hanukkah</b> begins at sundown on Wednesday, Dec. 25 and lasts <b>until</b> sundown on Thursday, Jan. 2.  This year, <b>Hanukkah</b> begins on Wednesday, December 25, 2024, and runs <b>until</b> Thursday, January 2, 2025. You can see why it gets confused as a Jewish version of Christmas&mdash;the dates are very...  When <b>Hanukkah</b> begins on its earliest start date (November 27th) it occasionally overlaps with American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, what some have playfully dubbed Thanksgivukkah. (<b>Thanksgiving</b> also does not have a fixed calendar date because it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of the month of November.)  In 2021, Hanukkah will begin on Sunday, Nov. 28, at the tail end of the Thanksgiving weekend, and conclude on Dec. 6, nearly <b>three</b> full weeks before Christmas. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving verses niv.
