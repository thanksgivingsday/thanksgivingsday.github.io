        <h2><strong>Is thanksgiving celebrated in guatemala I hope you have a happy thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving </b>turkey is often stuffed with a traditional savory bread pudding and roasted. Sage is the standard herb added to the stuffing, along with chopped onions and celery. [28] [29] Other ingredients, such as chopped chestnuts or other tree nuts, crumbled sausage or bacon, carrots, cranberries, raisins, and/or apples, may be added to stuffing.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving </b>is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Thanksgiving <b>is</b> a holiday in the United States and Canada when people give thanks. In the United States, it is on the fourth Thursday of November. In Canada, it is on the second Monday of October. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln said the last Thursday of November would be a national Day of Thanksgiving for the United States. [1]  <b>Thanksgiving </b>as a national holiday owes its origins to Sarah Josepha Hale, who lobbied Abraham Lincoln&mdash;and wrote &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;  <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  In the United States, the <b>Thanksgiving </b>holiday is a four-day holiday over a weekend, starting on <b>Thanksgiving </b>Thursday and ending on Sunday. Families and friends usually eat a special meal together (usually with a turkey as the main dish).  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is popularly modeled on a romanticized view of the Pilgrims of Plimouth Colony in Massachusetts in the 1620s. The story tends to go that they held a feast to thank both the Native Americans who had helped them survive through the winter and God whom they believed had led them to the New World.&hellip;  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving </b>is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621. </p>        <p><a href="./262.html">Costco thanksgiving refrigator</a>.
