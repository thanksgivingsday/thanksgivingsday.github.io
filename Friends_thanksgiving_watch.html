        <h2><strong>Friends thanksgiving watch San diego thanksgiving specials</strong></h2>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a good chance the Pilgrims and <b>Wampanoag</b> did in <b>fact</b> <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b> as part of that very first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Wild turkey was a common food source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds. Did they come back with any turkey?  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, <b>turkey</b> is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> <b>turkey</b> in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony ...  Today&rsquo;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes. However, the very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> most likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison.  An 1841 collection of Pilgrim writing had referred to the meal described by Winslow as &ldquo;the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; Although Winslow didn&rsquo;t specifically mention <b>turkey</b>, his fellow colonist William Bradford <b>did</b> refer to a &ldquo;great store of wild Turkies&rdquo; at Plymouth that fall, in a journal that was reprinted in 1856. Before long, the ...  Despite the fact that Bradford never stated they <b>ate</b> turkey at the Thanksgiving feast, Hale started publishing articles about Thanksgiving dinners with roasted turkey and the two became synonymous. Many people believe Thanksgiving became a reoccurring celebration for the pilgrims.  <b>No</b>, the first Thanksgiving was probably held outdoors, including the meals. The English houses were too small to get everyone inside. Did they eat turkey? We don&#39;t think so. The Wampanoag guests...  Did Pilgrims Eat Turkey at Thanksgiving? The short <b>answer</b>: <b>Nobody</b> is sure if turkey was served at the harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in 1621, but &ldquo;wild fowl&rdquo; was certainly mentioned in historical accounts.  <b>It</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> <b>possible</b>, but <b>unlikely</b>, that there was turkey at the first Thanksgiving.
