        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving and christmas borders Thanksgiving food item</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> <b>and</b> <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North <b>America</b>. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees.  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday <b>evolved</b> to the tradition it is today.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  It took the Civil War&mdash;and with it the perceived need for a gesture to build national unity&mdash;for Lincoln to declare a day of thanksgiving for the U.S. in <b>October</b> <b>1863</b>, to be celebrated the following month. The story of the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving,&rdquo; however, is more complicated than that which is commonly taught in schools.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] . Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Almost every culture in the world has celebrations of thanks for a plentiful harvest. The legend of the American Thanksgiving holiday is said to have been based on a feast of thanksgiving in the early days of the American colonies <b>almost</b> <b>400</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>U.S</b>. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November.
