        <h2><strong>When is indiana university thanksgiving break Best time to buy a turkey for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is popularly modeled on a romanticized view of the Pilgrims of Plimouth Colony in Massachusetts in the 1620s. The story tends to go that they held a feast to thank both the Native Americans who had helped them survive through the <b>winter</b> and God whom they believed had led them to the New World.&hellip;  These cyclical celebrations welcome the summer&#39;s first strawberries, the first green beans, the tapping of maple trees, the month of storytelling during the depths of <b>winter</b>, and more....  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday of <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  This 1623 <b>festival</b> appears to have been the origin of our <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day because it combined a religious and social <b>celebration</b>. Festivals of Thanksgiving were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years.  Dropping anchor off the coast of Cape Cod on 11 November 1620, the 102 passengers of the Mayflower understood they were on their own, <b>winter</b> had already begun, they were short on supplies, and had arrived too late to plant any crops.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  The Mid-Autumn <b>Festival</b>, also known as the Moon <b>Festival</b>, is one of the most important holidays on the Chinese calendar. It is celebrated under the Full Moon on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, usually in late September or early October. The tradition of the Mid-Autumn <b>Festival</b> dates back over 3000 years. </p>        <p>Vegan thanksgiving mushroom wellington. Jets thanksgiving game 2024.
