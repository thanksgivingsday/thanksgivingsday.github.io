        <h2><strong>Is the first thanksgiving the same day as our thanksgiving Quick thanksgiving breakfast</strong></h2>
        <p>A <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Piecaken</b> is a hybrid <b>dessert</b> that features two classic pies&mdash;pumpkin and pecan&mdash;baked into moist layers of spice cake. Frosted with cream cheese frosting and drizzled with caramel sauce, this dessert is a celebration of holiday flavors in every slice.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Piecaken</b>: <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>Pie</b>, Pecan <b>Pie</b>, Apple Upside-Down Cake Food This holiday-perfect spin on the original PieCaken starts with a store-bought or homemade pecan pie and...  With 50+ <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>piecaken</b> <b>recipes</b> at your disposal, you can bring an array of flavors and textures to your holiday table. From classic pumpkin pie and rich chocolate cake to unique flavor combinations like apple spice and caramel pecan, there&rsquo;s a <b>piecaken</b> <b>recipe</b> for everyone.  World-renowned pastry chef Zac Young&#39;s signature <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>dessert</b>. 1 (9 inch) pumpkin pie (store-bought or your favorite recipe, mine is from the back of the Libby&#39;s can!) 4 large egg whites (totally clean, no yolks!) 6oz rolled oats. Preheat the oven to 350. Spray a 8&rdquo; cake pan with non-stick spray and line with a round of parchment paper.  &quot;Can&#39;t decide between <b>cake</b> or <b>pie</b> for <b>dessert</b>? Don&#39;t. This epic confection hits all the right flavor notes, textures and will undoubtedly be the most impressive dessert you ever make.&quot;  Executive Pastry Chef Zac Young of the David Burke Group now makes the <b>PieCaken</b> <b>for Thanksgiving</b>, the <b>dessert</b> version of turducken. The three-layer confection consists of layers of pecan pie, pumpkin pie and apple upside down cake, along with cinnamon buttercream.  It&rsquo;s hard to go wrong by making a delicious <b>piecaken</b> <b>dessert</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. This <b>dessert</b> takes three traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>desserts</b> and combines them into one tasty treat. Thank you so much for stopping by to check out how you can easily make this <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>piecaken</b> <b>recipe</b>.  First, prepare your cake batter &ndash; get a box of chocolate cake mix (I used Chocolate Fudge cake mix) and prepare it according to the box instructions with oil, eggs and water. Simple! Pour half of it into a greased 9&Prime; springform pan &ndash; this is KEY and a must for a <b>piecaken</b> since it makes it so easy to remove after it has baked.  This <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>piecaken</b> is the perfect combination of <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b>, <b>cinnamon</b> <b>cheesecake</b>, and spice <b>cake</b>. It&rsquo;s an over-the-top Thanksgiving dessert that is sure to impress! </p>        <p>Splitcoaststampers gallery stampin up thanksgiving. Thanksgiving staten island mall hours.
