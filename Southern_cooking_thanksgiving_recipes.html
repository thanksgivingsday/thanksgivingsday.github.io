        <p>Thanksgiving Manners for <b>Guests</b>. 1. When you&rsquo;re invited, ask what you can bring. Thanksgiving dinners aren&rsquo;t like most dinners where the guests don&rsquo;t bring anything but their appetite. This is a feast, so your host might appreciate the help. As you ask, offer some suggestions of what you&rsquo;re comfortable bringing.  When sending out invitations, whether for a special event or a casual gathering, it&rsquo;s essential to properly convey whether your guest is allowed to bring a &ldquo;<b>plus</b> one&rdquo; &ndash; an additional guest. Clearly expressing this information ensures that your event runs smoothly and avoids any misunderstandings.  Before you head out <b>to Thanksgiving </b>dinner, Food Network will help you make sure your etiquette is up <b>to </b>snuff so that you get invited back next year.  Q. Can I bring my friend to Thanksgiving dinner? A. Typically if the invitation does not specify &ldquo;and guest&rdquo; you <b>cannot</b> <b>ask</b> to bring one. However, Thanksgiving is a little different. It&rsquo;s a holiday where we share friendship, family and our bounty.  You don&#39;t want to be the <b>one</b> the host is trying to get out the door, so be sure to read the room, and know when to leave. &quot;Make sure to leave at an appropriate time. You will sense the atmosphere by observing the host&#39;s body <b>language</b> and the departure of the rest of the <b>guests</b>,&quot; Parker says.  Meier never <b>asks</b> for <b>a</b> <b>plus</b> <b>one</b>. &quot;If you haven&#39;t been given a plus one, don&#39;t bring one. And, even asking your host for one puts them in a very uncomfortable position. And above all, never...  <b>Ask</b> some close friends or good conversationalists to come early and be the first guests. This deflects the awkward early phase and allows you to get on with prep. On Thanksgiving, your...  Here are five sticky situations and their solutions from host and/or <b>guest</b> perspectives. 1. Sticky situation: An extra guest accompanies an invited <b>guest</b>. Host: When hosting a large group, set up an extra place setting, reserved for a mystery guest.  I would never <b>ask</b> to bring an additional <b>guest</b> to a person&#39;s home or a sit down function where the host has sent out formal invitations (such as a shower or wedding). If a <b>plus</b> <b>one</b> is allowed, the host will usually specify that in the invite. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving tracebles.
