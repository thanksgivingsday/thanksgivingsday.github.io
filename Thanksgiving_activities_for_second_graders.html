        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving activities for second graders Thanksgiving story esl</strong></h2>
        <p>This time last year, the New York Times&mdash;and its many readers&mdash;discovered a quaint little tradition that many Americans had never heard of: <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  So it may surprise some to learn that, although America feels proprietary about Thanksgiving, Canadian Thanksgiving was actually first. The first Thanksgiving in Canada has been credited to English <b>explorer</b> Martin Frobisher. According to historical records, he celebrated in 1578 in what we now know as Newfoundland.  Origins of Canadian Thanksgiving Canadian Thanksgiving kicked off with a feast of biscuits, salt beef, and mushy peas <b>in</b> <b>1578</b>. That&rsquo;s when Sir Martin Frobisher sailed from England in search of...  Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions. [2] [3] [4] Thanksgiving has been officially celebrated as an annual holiday in Canada since <b>November</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1879</b>. [5]  TL;DR: This blog post explores the true history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada, revealing how European colonizers adopted Indigenous traditions while perpetuating harm. It traces the origins of Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>to</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>festivals</b>, <b>emphasizing</b> the <b>Haudenosaunee</b> <b>Confederacy</b>&#39;<b>s</b> influence.  The first Thanksgiving celebrated by European settlers in North America took place <b>in</b> <b>1578</b> in what is now Nunavut. The settlers ate a meal to celebrate and give thanks for their safe arrival after their trip across the ocean.  <b>Origins</b> and <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Canada. Indigenous peoples in North America have a <b>history</b> of holding communal feasts in celebration of the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  Canadian Thanksgiving is rooted <b>in</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>values</b>, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies.  In this article I take a brief look at the <b>origins</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American Thanksgiving myth of the first US Thanksgiving but what of the early Canadian celebrations. </p>        <p>Bobs burgers lisa thanksgiving.
