        <p>Over the last 400 years, what started out as a resourceful dessert&mdash;gourds and spices were plentiful at the time, while butter, sugar, and other sweet ingredients were not&mdash;has <b>become</b> <b>a Thanksgiving</b> <b>tradition</b> that&#39;s now as iconic as the Macy&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade or fighting over the turkey wishbone. Since <b>pumpkin</b> was already associated ...  The menu is flexible&mdash;it&rsquo;s all about giving thanks for the bounties of the year&mdash;but there are <b>traditional</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> ideas and elements that would be odd to exclude: a stuffed, roasted turkey, cranberry sauce, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b>. But what is the historical origin of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal?  But how did pumpkin pie become so irrevocably tied to the Thanksgiving holiday? That has everything to do with Sarah Josepha <b>Hale</b>, a New Hampshire-born writer and editor who is often called the...  New England unionists embraced <b>Thanksgiving</b> with a newfound fervor, and the newly symbolic <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> took center stage as the <b>traditional</b> dessert for this holiday. Confederates in the South, however, were reluctant to celebrate something in the middle of the war that had such deep ties to New England <b>tradition</b>.

To understand the surprising trajectory of the orange pumpkin, it&rsquo;s important...  &ldquo;And she said pumpkin pie is the American pie.&rdquo; <b>In</b> <b>1863</b>, Hale convinced President Abraham Lincoln to declare a national day of Thanksgiving. Pumpkin pie remains closely linked to the holiday.  One of the mainstays of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day table is <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b>. But when <b>did</b> <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> <b>become</b> associated with the holiday? Though <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> has changed through the years, <b>pumpkin</b>, which is native to North America, may have been part of the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day feast.  The recipe for pumpkin pie was reimagined so many times that it wasn&#39;t until the early 18th century that a standard recipe was born. In fact, Thanksgiving of <b>1705</b> led to <b>a</b> <b>molasses</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>in</b> the town of <b>Colchester</b>, <b>Connecticut</b>, which meant families would have to forgo pumpkin pie. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving buffet san diego.
