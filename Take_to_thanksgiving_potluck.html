        <h2><strong>Take to thanksgiving potluck Dmv closed on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving Day, observed in <b>2024</b> <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>, honors a 1621 feast between Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag people.  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  <b>Thanksgiving Day</b> is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;<b>Day</b> of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  <b>On</b> <b>September</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1789</b>, just before leaving for recess, the first Federal Congress passed a resolution asking that the President of the United States recommend to the nation a day of thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] . Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates <b>in</b> <b>October</b> <b>and</b> <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  The first Thanksgiving was a <b>harvest</b> <b>celebration</b> held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. </p>        <p>Hotel albuquerque thanksgiving dinner.
