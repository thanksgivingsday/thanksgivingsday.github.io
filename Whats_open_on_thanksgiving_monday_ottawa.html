        <p>Here are thirty-seven <b>sermons</b> appropriate for <b>Thanksgiving</b>. You are welcome to use this material in any way that might be helpful to you as you prepare sermons <b>and</b> Bible studies or simply to increase your own gratitude to the Lord for all his blessings.  MPT: It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will for Christians to give <b>thanks</b> in all circumstances. MPS: <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a command for all contexts that is part of our calling. Happy <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Summit Church.  theology of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. &ldquo;Theology&rdquo; is the study of the doctrine of God. The theology behind our <b>thanksgiving</b> can be seen in a very familiar passage of scripture. It is Romans chapter 8. Here we read: &ldquo;And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.  <b>Sermon</b> Outlines <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2 Corinthians 9:15 - &ldquo;Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.&rdquo; The Christian life has been called &ldquo;a life of continual thanksgiving&rdquo; ~ not simply thanksgiving at certain times but &ldquo;continual&rdquo; ~ &ldquo;giving thanks always&rdquo; (Eph. 5:20). In order for this we must realize what we have. St. Paul  A <b>THANKSGIVING</b> <b>SERMON</b> 1 CHRONICLES 16:1-36 INTRO: I am certain that EVERYONE OF US LOOKS FORWARD TO THE THANKSGIVING SEASON for various reasons. 1) For family gatherings. 2) For a vacation. 3) For Football. 4) For Rest. 5) For Food.

And, through his experience, we learn the same four steps. Stop, look, listen, and Praise God! Have you used this in your life? Perhaps it&rsquo;s the application of these steps that will keep this <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Sermon</b> from merely being another clich&eacute;d, canned nicety.  <b>Sermon</b> &ndash; <b>Thanksgiving</b> Sunday October 10, 2021 Happy Thanksgiving! Thanksgiving is a time to gather with family and friends. It&rsquo;s a time to pig out and eat too much food. This week, I came across a Thanksgiving blessing that I thought would be extremely relevant. It goes: May your stuffing be tasty May your turkey be plump  In a nutshell: <b>Thanksgiving</b> must be given to the one responsible for whatever it is that we are thankful for. Regardless of our blessings, everyone who has a relationship with God can give thanks to God for these three things: The Lord is Good; His love endures forever; and His faithfulness endures to all generations. B. History of <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  1 O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 2 Let us come before his presence with <b>thanksgiving</b>, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 3 For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinners for sale near me.
