        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>football</b> <b>games</b> in the United States are nearly as old as the <b>game</b>&mdash;and the organized holiday&mdash;themselves. The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>football</b> <b>game</b> took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day of 1869, less than two weeks after Rutgers defeated Princeton in New Brunswick, New Jersey in what is widely recognized as the first intercollegiate <b>football</b> <b>game</b> in the ...

The <b>NFL</b> began in 1920, but the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>game</b> didn&rsquo;t occur until 14 years later.  A year after that initial <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>game</b> in Detroit, the Lions collected the first <b>NFL</b> title in team <b>history</b>. Detroit would win three more championships in the 1950s before enduring a title ...  The Cardinals lost both <b>games</b> decidedly, and Rozelle went back to Schramm to ask whether the Cowboys would take the <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>game</b> back. &quot;It was a dud in St. Louis,&quot; Schramm said in 1988 to the ...  In April 1966, the <b>NFL</b> added a second <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>game</b> at the behest of television networks. On November 24, 1966, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Cleveland Browns at the Cotton Bowl, 26-14 ...
