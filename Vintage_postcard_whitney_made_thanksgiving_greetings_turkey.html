        <h2><strong>Vintage postcard whitney made thanksgiving greetings turkey English settlers who celebrated the first thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1620, about 100 religious <b>Pilgrims</b> left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans...  Most of the attendees <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>were</b> men; 78 percent of the women who traveled on the Mayflower perished over the preceding winter. Of the 50 colonists who celebrated the...  And though today we might refer to the Puritans as &quot;<b>Pilgrims</b>,&quot; the Englishmen didn&rsquo;t call themselves that. NATIVE AMERICANS AND THANKSGIVING. The peace between the Native Americans and settlers...  Here&#39;s a look at how the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag people got down in 1621. Forget the pumpkin spice and candied yams, here&#39;s what the 1621 holiday feast actually entailed.

The <b>50</b> remaining colonists and <b>roughly</b> <b>90</b> Wampanoag tribesmen attended the &quot;First Thanksgiving.&quot; The major similarity between the first Jamestown settlers and the first Plymouth settlers was great human suffering.  About half of the <b>102</b> <b>Pilgrims</b> who arrived the year before died the first winter, meaning native people would have nearly doubled the 50 or so Pilgrims at the 1621 event.  Just <b>over</b> <b>50</b> colonists are believed to have attended, including <b>22</b> <b>men</b>, four married women&mdash;including Edward Winslow&rsquo;s wife&mdash;and more than 25 children and teenagers. </p>        <p>Happy thanksgiving closed sign and friday. <b>Vintage postcard whitney made thanksgiving greetings turkey</b>.
