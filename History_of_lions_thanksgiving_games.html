        <h2><strong>History of lions thanksgiving games Why do we eat turkey on thanksgiving yahoo</strong></h2>
        <p>The story behind Thanksgiving starts <b>in</b> <b>1620</b> when a group of Protestants, who had left their native England after they were persecuted for their religion there, landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  In <b>1621</b>, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the...  The first Thanksgiving was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. The first account <b>is</b> <b>William</b> Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip;  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  During the autumn of 1621, at least 90 Wampanoag joined 52 English people at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, to mark a successful harvest. It is remembered today as the &ldquo;<b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>,&rdquo; although no one back then used that term. In fact, much of the so-<b>called</b> <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> story was created decades and centuries later.  The Pilgrims and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table. </p>        <p>Vinyl thanksgiving for women.
