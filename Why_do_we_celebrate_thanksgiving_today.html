        <h2><strong>Why do we celebrate thanksgiving today Tj rockwells thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The first Thanksgiving was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in <b>the</b> <b>17th</b> <b>century</b>. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  In <b>1846</b>, Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of a magazine called Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book, campaigned for an annual national thanksgiving holiday. But it wasn&#39;t until 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln...  In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people.  It wasn&rsquo;t until <b>1863</b>, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day to be held each <b>November</b>. But the holiday is not without controversy...  Today&rsquo;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes. However, the <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> most likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison.  When Americans rediscovered Winslow&#39;s account in <b>1822</b>, the unremarkable harvest feast of <b>1621</b> was elevated to become the &ldquo;First Thanksgiving.&rdquo; 6 By that time, American Thanksgiving practices had come to resemble that earlier feast. As it is celebrated today, Thanksgiving has very little to do with Plymouth in 1621.  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is dated <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday? Thanksgiving became an American holiday in 1863 but was not observed in every state until after 1963. Why do Native Americans object to Thanksgiving?  The story behind Thanksgiving starts <b>in</b> <b>1620</b> when a group of Protestants, who had left their native England after they were persecuted for their religion there, landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  A look at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>: The year was 1621, and the Pilgrims had just survived their <b>first</b> brutal winter in the New World, though nearly half of their group perished. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving wiki en.
