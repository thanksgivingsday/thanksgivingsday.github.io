        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> means <b>stuffing</b>, but which recipe has the perfect balance of texture and savory flavor? This taste test of five of the most popular stuffing <b>recipes</b> on Allrecipes.com provides an answer.  Better than the turkey, this <b>stuffing</b> is what reminds me of <b>Thanksgivings</b> around the family table. Rather than stuff the Turkey with it, I use it as a side dish.&quot; Chop onion, celery, carrots and garlic in <b>food</b> processor. Combine vegetables with butter and saute for 10 minutes.  <b>Grandma</b>&#39;s old <b>fashioned</b> <b>stuffing</b> recipe is a holiday classic made with day-old bread, savory herbs, and butter. Perfect for <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Christmas or any festive meal. Print Recipe  &quot;I&#39;ve been eating this every <b>Thanksgiving</b> since I was little. It wouldn&#39;t be <b>Thanksgiving</b> without it. Make this the night before you&#39;re going to use it to let all the flavors blend. I boil the turkey liver in chicken stock for extra flavor&quot;  <b>Heat</b> oven to 350&deg;F (unless <b>stuffing</b> in a turkey or chicken, cook as usual for a stuffed bird). In a small sauce pan add half the onions, all the celery, all the potato and all the broth and water. Bring to a boil and cook around 10-15 minutes or until potatoes, onions and celery are nice and soft.  Our <b>family</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner would never be complete without this homemade <b>stuffing</b> recipe that has been in my Mom&rsquo;s family for years. It is so simple and delicious, never dry, perfectly textured and crisp around the edges, and just the best <b>stuffing</b> recipe you&rsquo;ll ever try.  <b>Grandma</b>&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Stuffing</b> is made with chicken broth, a mixture of amazing savory herbs and spices, and just the right amount of butter. A little crunchy on top and soft and chewy in the middle, it&rsquo;s everything you want in a classic stuffing recipe.  A classic, traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>stuffing</b> that is perfectly moist and perfectly seasoned with onion, celery, and sage. It will be the star of your feast, and the only <b>stuffing</b> recipe you&#39;ll ever need!  Dotdash Meredith <b>Food</b> Studios.
