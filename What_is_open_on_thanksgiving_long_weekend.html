Once you find a <b>food</b> bank <b>near</b> you, you can find drop-off information, operation hours, and even their most needed items.  Contact a <b>food</b> bank or <b>food</b> <b>pantry</b> <b>near</b> you about volunteering well before the holidays. With so many people interested in volunteering over the holidays, spots can fill up quickly and you may need to attend a volunteer orientation before you start. Be open to helping where you&#39;re needed most.  To locate a <b>nearby</b> food bank, food <b>pantry</b>, or other food assistance, use Feeding America&#39;s online search tool. Call the USDA National Hunger Hotline at 1-866-348-6479 or (1-877-842-6273 for Spanish). Information is available in English and Spanish. The hotline operates Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM Eastern Time.  Find how to get a free Thanksgiving dinner <b>near</b> you. Charities or churches serve a meal or giveaway a free turkey or Thanksgiving <b>food</b> basket in 2024 to senior citizens and low-income families.  From local <b>food</b> drives and meal delivery services to footraces for a cause (like turkey trots) and serving <b>food</b> at soup kitchens, here&rsquo;s where to volunteer on Thanksgiving in 2024. Read on so you can give <b>thanks</b> by giving back.  There are many different Thanksgiving volunteer opportunities available, depending on where you live.
