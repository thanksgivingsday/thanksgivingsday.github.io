        <p>The <b>first</b> national <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day <b>did</b> not invoke the <b>Pilgrims</b> at all. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day on the last Thursday of November, looking to reconcile a ...  The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag shared a harvest feast, but it didn&#39;t happen the way you were likely taught in school. Every November, Americans gather around the table to <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in ...  &quot;The first thanksgiving,&quot; as a Pilgrim feast in 1621 subsequently came to be known, was not a religious celebration. Instead, the Pilgrims held a three-day feast to celebrate the success of their first <b>harvest</b> sometime between September and early October in 1621.  The first Thanksgiving. In the Fall of 1621, the Pilgrims famously shared a <b>harvest</b> <b>feast</b> with the <b>Pokanokets</b>; the meal is now considered the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists (<b>Pilgrims</b>) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  As was the custom in England, the Pilgrims celebrated their <b>harvest</b> <b>with</b> a <b>festival</b>. The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 Wampanoag tribesmen attended the &quot;First Thanksgiving.&quot; The major similarity between the first Jamestown settlers and the first Plymouth settlers <b>was</b> <b>great</b> <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b>.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the <b>Pilgrims</b> of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table. </p>        <p><a href="./758.html">Which des moines restaurants serving thanksgiving dinner</a>.
