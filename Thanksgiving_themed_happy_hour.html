        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving themed happy hour Holiday thanksgiving crafts</strong></h2>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  Thanksgiving Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as <b>Spanish</b> and <b>English</b> <b>days</b> of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  It took the Civil War&mdash;and with it the perceived need for a gesture to build national unity&mdash;for Lincoln to declare a day of thanksgiving for the U.S. in <b>October</b> <b>1863</b>, to be celebrated the following month. The story of the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving,&rdquo; however, is more complicated than that which is commonly taught in schools.  President James Madison proclaimed a day of Thanksgiving to be held <b>on</b> <b>April</b> <b>13</b>, <b>1815</b>, the last such proclamation issued by a President until Abraham Lincoln did so in 1862. Most of the credit for the establishment of an annual Thanksgiving holiday may be given to Sarah Josepha Hale.  Thanksgiving Day became an official U.S. holiday in <b>1863</b>, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. A traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;<b>Day</b> of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> <b>and</b> <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island. </p>        <p>Childrens thanksgiving poems songs. How many people were at the first thanksgiving.
