        <h2><strong>3-6 month old thanksgiving dress What is the weather like in san diego during thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Gratitude comes less naturally in seasons of loss, but the Word of God gives <b>Christians</b> clear instructions: &ldquo;Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&rdquo; (1 Thessalonians 5:18, ESV).  What exactly should Christians give thanks for and why? &quot;Giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; ~ <b>Ephesians</b> <b>5:20</b>  I do not celebrate Thanksgiving, but since many of my readers do, I thought I would share a few things we all should be grateful for as Christians. Here they are: <b>1</b>. God&rsquo;<b>s</b> <b>attributes</b>. Know that the Lord, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.  Verses all through the Bible point us back to God as our Creator and Sustainer, and how we are to be a <b>thankful</b> people. The list of things we could praise Him for is endless. But here are just a few reasons to give thanks to God all year long.  There are so many reasons to intentionally cultivate gratitude! Let&rsquo;s unpack the power of gratitude with these 12 benefits of giving God thanks. (And go even deeper with this free 30-day Gratitude Bible Reading Plan.) <b>1</b>.Gratitude <b>glorifies</b> God. This alone would be reason to give thanks to God.  The reason for thanksgiving is found in the <b>saving</b> <b>acts</b> of God because it is these blessings that deliver believers out of Satan&rsquo;s domain of darkness and into the realm of light and spiritual fruitfulness.  The psalmist declared, &ldquo;Sing to the Lord with <b>thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; (Psalm 147:7, NIV). Paul wrote, &ldquo;Be <b>thankful</b>&rdquo; (Colossians 3:15, NIV). A spirit of <b>thanksgiving</b> is always the mark of a joyous <b>Christian</b>. <b>Why</b> should we be <b>thankful</b>? Because God has blessed us, and we should be <b>thankful</b> for each blessing.  Most verses go on to list reasons why we should thank Him, such as &ldquo;<b>His</b> <b>love</b> <b>endures</b> <b>forever</b>&rdquo; (Psalm 136:3), &ldquo;He is good&rdquo; (Psalm 118:29), and &ldquo;His mercy is everlasting&rdquo; (Psalm 100:5). Thanksgiving and praise always go together. We cannot adequately praise and worship God without also being thankful.  To sinners forever saved by grace, <b>thanksgiving</b> should be significant. Even central. Healthy <b>Christians</b> <b>are thankful</b> <b>Christians</b>. In fact, Romans 1:21 shows us that <b>thanksgiving</b> is what we were created for, and it is &ldquo;at the heart of what it means to be a <b>Christian</b>,&rdquo; says Tremper Longman. </p>        <p><a href="./308.html">Thanksgiving turkey at kfc</a>.
