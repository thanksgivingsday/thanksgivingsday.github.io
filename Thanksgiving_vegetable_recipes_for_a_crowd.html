        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in November, determined by an act of Congress in 1941. Prior to that, the date of <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a bit of a political football.  By federal law, Americans have celebrated Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday in November <b>since</b> <b>1942</b>, but numerous other dates were designated in the past. It is believed that America&rsquo;s first Thanksgiving, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668 ...  The House agreed to the amendment, and Roosevelt signed the resolution on Dec. 26, 1941, establishing the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in November as the federal <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day holiday.  Almost 170 years after the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe feasted together for the first unofficial Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, the U.S. government decided to make it official.  To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United States entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> in November.

Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> November.

On <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  Why is Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November? President George Washington declared Thursday, Nov. <b>26</b>, <b>1789</b> as a &quot;Day of Publick Thanksgivin,&quot; after he was asked by the first Federal... </p>        <p>Traditional canadian thanksgiving food.
