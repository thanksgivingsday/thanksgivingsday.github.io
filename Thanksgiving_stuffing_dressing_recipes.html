        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving stuffing dressing recipes What channel to watch thanksgiving parade</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Around</b> <b>46</b> <b>million</b> <b>turkeys</b> are eaten around <b>Thanksgiving</b>, according to the US Poultry and Egg Association. That&#39;s around as many turkeys as the entire population of Spain.  As celebrated in the United States, the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> usually revolves around a bountiful meal. Typical dishes include bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, and, above all, <b>turkey</b>. How did <b>turkey</b> become the centerpiece of this feast?  &quot;Why do we eat <b>turkey</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>?&quot; is a question many of us ask amid the fixings and trimmings. Turkey wasn&rsquo;t always at the heart of the holiday table. We tapped an expert to help explain how turkey became inextricably associated with Thanksgiving, and here&#39;s what we found out.  How did the <b>turkey</b> become a popular <b>Thanksgiving</b> centerpiece? Why do we eat <b>turkey</b> at <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Did the Pilgrims eat turkey? What about pumpkin pie? See how foods differed from today&mdash;and some historically inspired recipes, too!  By 1789, when George Washington declared a <b>day</b> of national <b>thanksgiving</b>&mdash;a one-off, not a recurring holiday&mdash;Americans were eating quite a bit of <b>turkey</b>.  Historians now believe <b>turkey</b> wasn&rsquo;t actually <b>consumed</b> during what was often cited as the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal between the Pilgrim settlers and the Wampanoag tribe in 1621. Instead, it has been suggested they ate deer, along with other wild fowl, such as goose or duck.  Regardless of how <b>turkey</b> is cooked &ndash; whether roasted, brined, grilled, air-fried, or smoked &mdash; eating <b>turkey</b> fresh from the oven <b>on Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> is one of the most delicious and nutrtitious ways to <b>consume</b> the famous bird.  When you divide the total weight of Thanksgiving turkeys (1.4 billion pounds) by the number of turkey-eating Americans, each person consumes an average of <b>over</b> <b>4</b> <b>pounds</b> of turkey meat on Thanksgiving Day! Of course, household turkey consumption varies widely depending on the number of guests.  Why exactly the <b>Turkey</b> has been the star of &ldquo;<b>Turkey</b> <b>Day</b>&rdquo; since at least the mid-19th century is a matter of much debate, particularly given the consensus amongst historians that the Pilgrims... </p>        <p>Interesting facts about canadian thanksgiving.
