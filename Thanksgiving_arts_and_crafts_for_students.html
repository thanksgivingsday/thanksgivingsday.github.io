        <p>Known as &lsquo;<b>勤労感謝の日</b>&rsquo; (<b>Kinrō</b> <b>Kansha</b> <b>no</b> <b>Hi</b>), Thanksgiving in Japan stands as a recognized national holiday. The focus of this day centers around worker appreciation, highlighting the exchange...  In Japan, this gratitude is expressed during 勤労感謝の日 (Kinrō Kansha no Hi) or Labor Thanksgiving Day. Celebrated on November <b>23rd</b>, this national holiday honors workers&rsquo; hard work and dedication across all industries. 1. A Quick Jump To&hellip; 2. The Origins of Kinrō Kansha no Hi. 3. The Evolution of Kinrō Kansha no Hi. 4.  Labor <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (勤労感謝の日, Kinrō Kansha no Hi) is an annual public holiday in Japan celebrated on November 23 of each year, [1] unless that day falls on a Sunday, in which case the holiday is moved to Monday. [2]  But even though Japan doesn&#39;t have Thanksgiving the same way we understand it in the US, Japan still has a <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday right around the same time. It&#39;s called kinrōkanshahi 勤労感謝の日 きんろうかんしゃひ 勤労感謝の日, or Labor Thanksgiving Day, and it&#39;s a national holiday.  Japan&rsquo;s Labor Thanksgiving Day is celebrated <b>every</b> <b>November</b> <b>23rd</b>. The history of Japanese Thanksgiving goes back over 2,000 years, when it was a harvest ritual called Niiname-sai. Mentions of Niiname-sai are chronicled in the Nihon Shoki (the second oldest book of classical Japanese history).  In <b>Japan</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is known as Kinrōkansha no Hi (勤労感謝の日), which in <b>Japanese</b> means &quot;Labor <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day&quot;, and it&#39;s <b>celebrated</b> on November 23rd every year. The date is different from the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> (the last Thursday in November).  Thanksgiving in Japan, also known as 勤労感謝の日きんろうかんしゃひ (kinrōkanshahi), is one of the national holidays. To celebrate workers in Japan, gifts such as letters and cards are exchanged as gestures of thanks for the hard work they put. Japanese Thanksgiving always falls <b>on</b> <b>November</b> <b>23</b> every <b>year</b>.  In Japan, <b>November</b> <b>23</b> is observed, officially since 1948, as a day off in respect to what the name literally says: &quot;thanks for giving&quot;. It is in reality an older tradition. This &quot;Labor Thanksgiving Day&quot;, as it is called today, was respected as early as November 678.  You&rsquo;ll wanna <b>mark</b> <b>November</b> <b>23rd</b> in your calendars because that&rsquo;s when they celebrate Kinrō Kansha no Hi (勤労感謝の日) &ndash; also translated as the day for Thanksgiving in Japan! This special national holiday is for showing mad appreciation to all the hard-working hunnies in Japan. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving draw and write. The first thanksgiving 10 facts.
