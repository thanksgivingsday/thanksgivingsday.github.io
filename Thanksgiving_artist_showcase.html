        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving artist showcase Play thanksgiving holiday house escape</strong></h2>
        <p>From the words we say upon arising (&quot;Modeh ani l&#39;fanecha,&quot; &quot; I give thanks to You [for compassionately restoring my soul]&quot;) to the daily multitude of blessings and prayers in our worship services, our tradition teaches us that showing gratitude is part of our way of life.  Of course the main theme of the holiday of Thanksgiving comes from the name itself, reminding us of the importance of giving thanks. Saying &ldquo;<b>thank</b> <b>you</b>&rdquo; is a primary Jewish value. When a Jew sits down to eat, he or she says: &ldquo;<b>Blessed</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>God</b>, for bringing bread from the <b>earth</b>.&rdquo;  Unlike Christmas vs. Chanukah or Easter vs. Passover, where there are clear theological conflicts and a myriad of real-life complications, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is conflict-free (unless you talk politics, in which case you&rsquo;ll probably need more than prayers to navigate that terrain with grace and peace).  Help ensure <b>Jewish </b>news remains accessible to all. Your donation to the <b>Jewish </b>Telegraphic Agency powers the trusted journalism that has connected <b>Jewish </b>communities worldwide for more than 100 years.  We know that bringing a <b>thanksgiving</b> offering is not obligatory; it is a voluntary heartfelt gesture. The priests and the courts could never demand that someone bring a todah. How can Rashi then imply that specific cases require one to offer an animal as evidence of his thanks?  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a classic American holiday, but it&rsquo;s also quintessentially Jewish&mdash;<b>nothing</b> is more Jewish than taking time out to feel gratitude and say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for all our blessings. Here are five ways to tap into Jewish wisdom to enhance your Thanksgiving.  If Thanksgiving calls us into gratitude for our <b>blessings</b>, (Thanks)giving invites us to consider whether and how much others receive blessings by the ways we walk in the world. We ask this (Thanks)giving question, however, not to elicit thanks but precisely for an opposite reason.  It turns out that thanksgiving (or giving thanks) is very Jewish. In fact, the very term Jew (Yehudi) is directly linked to the Hebrew word hoda&rsquo;ah, which means &ldquo;thanks.&rdquo; Here are seven classic Jewish ways to express your gratitude: 1. <b>Todah</b> <b>Rabah</b>  The <b>Jewish </b>practice of counting our blessings encourages us to recognize and appreciate the sustenance in our lives. This regular acknowledgment can foster a lasting sense of gratitude. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving blessings wallpaper. Wildtree thanksgiving bundle.
