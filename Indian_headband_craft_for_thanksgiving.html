        <h2><strong>Indian headband craft for thanksgiving Applewood park slope thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>While not an <b>inherently</b> <b>religious</b> holiday, Thanksgiving celebration has caused debate within the Jewish community and illuminates the delicate balance that American Jews hold between their Jewish and American identities.  Did you know that <b>Thanksgiving</b> is really a <b>Jewish</b> holiday? Although <b>Thanksgiving</b> is not on the <b>Jewish</b> calendar, historians believe that Sukkot may have inspired America&rsquo;s favorite farewell...  As Jews, we always look to the <b>Torah</b> for a deeper perspective. What light does the Torah shed on the wonderful trait of thankfulness? And then there is Thanksgiving. The day when we thank Gâ€‘d for enabling all the above&mdash;and for all else He does for us.  Not only is it very possible to bring <b>Judaism</b> into <b>Thanksgiving</b>, in fact <b>Thanksgiving</b> very likely has its origins in the <b>Jewish</b> holiday of Sukkot.  The first and most significant issue in discussing whether it is halachic [acceptable according to <b>Jewish</b> law] to <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is whether it is permissible to eat a <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal, with the classical foods that American tradition indicates one should eat at this meal: turkey and cranberry sauce. Among the authorities of the ...  For some ultra-Orthodox Jews, Thanksgiving means a <b>pre</b>-<b>Shabbat</b> <b>feast</b> with family. For others, celebrating Thanksgiving is forbidden. Why?  Chanukah was declared a <b>Jewish</b> national holiday 2178 years ago. <b>Thanksgiving</b> was declared a national American holiday on the last Thursday of every November by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Before then, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated on different dates in different states, so we won&rsquo;t count those.  By drawing on Jewish values of hospitality and justice, we can view Thanksgiving as more than a day of <b>feasting</b>&mdash;<b>it</b> becomes a sacred opportunity to reconnect, express gratitude, and honor our shared responsibility to each other.  While we typically <b>don</b>&rsquo;<b>t</b> think <b>of</b> Thanksgiving as a particularly Jewish day, it has the potential to be the most Jewish of all the secular holidays. With its focus on gathering as a community, giving thanks, and being mindful, Thanksgiving is infused with central Jewish values. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving meal yakima. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/347.html">Bible verses about thanks for answered prayers</a>.
