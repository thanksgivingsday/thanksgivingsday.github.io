        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving parade on radio Black friday meaning day after thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United States <b>celebrated</b> on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. <b>Americans</b> generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest <b>feast</b> that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668, the holiday was celebrated on November 25, but that lasted only a few years.  In 1940 and 1941, FDR <b>celebrated</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second to last Thursdays in November, while some opponents continued to <b>celebrate</b> it on the last Thursday. To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United States entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in ...  Why is <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November? (In 2024, it&#39;s the LATEST this holiday can be held). What were the real reasons both Washington and Lincoln proclaimed a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>? (No, it&#39;s not about a Pilgrim feast.) Get the facts.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday <b>celebrated</b> each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast <b>celebrated</b> by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native <b>Americans</b> of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln declared it as such in 1863.  Most <b>Americans</b> are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North <b>America</b>. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees. </p>        <p>How american celebrate thanksgiving.
