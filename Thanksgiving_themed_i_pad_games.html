        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving themed i pad games Thanksgiving text for cards</strong></h2>
        <p>Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade is an American tradition held annually <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> since 1924. The parade features large balloons, floats, marching bands, and top performers. It is attended in person and watched on television by millions of viewers, and it has become a Thanksgiving staple.  The Macy&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving Day Parade</b> is an <b>annual</b> <b>parade</b> in New York City presented by the U.S.-based department store chain Macy&#39;s.The <b>Parade</b> <b>first</b> took place in 1924, [2]: 9 tying it for the second-oldest <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>parade</b> in the United States with America&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Parade</b> in Detroit (with both parades being four years younger than Philadelphia&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving Day Parade</b>).  Although the New York <b>parade</b> is the most widely-known, Macy&rsquo;s was not the <b>first</b> U.S. department store to hold a <b>parade</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>. <b>In 1920</b>, Gimbels <b>held</b> a <b>parade</b> in Philadelphia ...  It opened at <b>Herald</b> Square in 1902. The first parade was such a success that it was declared an annual tradition from there on out. The big event was originally called the Macy&rsquo;s Christmas Parade...  On <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1924, a <b>parade</b> set out from 145th Street in New York, and proceeded down the Upper West Side, all the way from Harlem to Midtown. This was the <b>first</b>-ever Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b>. The New York Times of November 28 described the event: &ldquo;Santa Claus chose <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> this year to come to town.&rdquo;  At 9 a.m. on the sunlit morning of November 27, 1924, Macy&rsquo;s gave the children of New York a particularly special <b>Thanksgiving</b> treat as a police escort led the start of the <b>parade</b> from the...  Philadelphia&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b>, the oldest in the United States, is steeped in history. <b>First</b> <b>held</b> <b>in 1920</b> , it was started by the Gimbel Brothers department store. The floats and performers paraded up Market Street towards the store, where Santa Claus then climbed a fire engine ladder into the toy department.  Where was the first Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade? Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade began in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> (where it remains), with the first one in 1924 beginning in Harlem and ending at Macy&#39;s Flagship store in Herald Square on 34th street.  On Nov. 27, 1924 at 9 a.m., the <b>first</b> Macy&rsquo;s <b>parade</b> started its way down a 6-mile route through the main streets of New York City. Since then, the <b>parade</b> route has been trimmed to 2.5 miles and the <b>parade</b> has grown, becoming one of the most beloved American traditions and bringing millions of people together every <b>Thanksgiving</b> morning. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving writing lesson plans first grade.
