        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner restaurants to go Buford highway farmers market thanksgiving hours</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a popular North American holiday that is central to the origin <b>story</b> of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, but other <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations may have taken place earlier.  The <b>myth</b> of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> refers to the mythologized retelling of a <b>1621</b> harvest feast by the Puritans in Plymouth, Massachusetts as the foundation for the modern Thanksgiving holiday as celebrated in the United States.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a holiday celebrated once a year on the fourth Thursday of November. In 1620 the Mayflower brought the Pilgrims to Massachusetts. They made their new home in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, 380 km northeast of what is now New York. Half of the Pilgrims died during their first winter in North America.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass.  What is the <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth? The myth is that friendly Indians, unidentified by tribe, welcome the Pilgrims to America, teach them how to live in this new place, sit down to dinner with them...  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of <b>1621</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28.
