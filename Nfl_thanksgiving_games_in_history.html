        <h2><strong>Nfl thanksgiving games in history Usc thanksgiving shuttle</strong></h2>
        <p>Canada celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common. Imagine the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday a month and a half...  Here is how Canada celebrates their big holiday as well as four ways that the <b>Canadian</b> and U.S. Thanksgivings differ. 1. <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> happens a full month and a half before American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  This is <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and why you should care about it. Just to be clear: Canada Celebrates Thanksgiving? Yes, every year, on the second Monday in October.  English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew had the first Canadian Thanksgiving in <b>1578</b>. As the story goes, in 1578, English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew gave thanks and communion was observed, either on land at Frobisher Bay, in present day Nunavut, or onboard a ship anchored there.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in Canada, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early <b>Canadian</b> celebrations.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an official statutory holiday in all provinces and territories except Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. It is called Action de gr&acirc;ce in Quebec and is celebrated to a much lesser extent there than in the rest of the country, given the holiday&rsquo;s Protestant origins and Anglo-nationalist associations.  Though Canada does have a first <b>Thanksgiving</b> story analogous to the U.S. story of the feast at Plymouth in 1621 &mdash; it involves the pirate/explorer Martin Frobisher giving thanks in 1578 for a safe...  Canadian Thanksgiving is rooted in <b>Indigenous</b> <b>values</b>, including giving thanks for surviving winter and for receiving crops and game as a reward for their hard work. First Nations traditions would include feasting, prayer, dance and other ceremonies.  What&#39;s the difference between <b>Thanksgiving</b> in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is <b>celebrated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of November but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.). </p>        <p>Dana in real life thanksgiving.
