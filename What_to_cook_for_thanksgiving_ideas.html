        <h2><strong>What to cook for thanksgiving ideas Can i lose weight with thanksgiving ham</strong></h2>
        <p>The first English thanksgiving in North America is credited <b>to</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> in 1578. He held a Thanksgiving for a safe anchorage in what is now Canada, not the US.  WASHINGTON &mdash; When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, we often picture steaming plates of turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the ...  The story of the First Thanksgiving comes from only two sources initially: Bradford and <b>Winslow</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>Mourt</b>&#39;<b>s</b> Relation, which gives a detailed account, and Bradford&#39;s Of Plymouth Plantation, which references the event in more general terms. Bradford writes:  One day, <b>Samoset</b>, a leader of the Abenaki people, and Tisquantum (better known as Squanto) visited the settlers. Squanto was a Wampanoag who had experience with other settlers and knew English....  When Americans rediscovered Winslow&#39;s account in 1822, the unremarkable harvest feast of 1621 was elevated to become the <b>&ldquo;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; 6 By that time, American <b>Thanksgiving</b> practices had come to resemble that earlier feast.  It was President <b>Lincoln</b> who declared Thanksgiving a national celebration in <b>1863</b>. The Plymouth Pilgrims simply celebrated survival, as well as the hopes of good fortune in the years that lay ahead. Thanksgiving Timeline  The First Thanksgiving On September <b>8</b>, <b>1565</b>, Pedro Men&eacute;ndez de Avil&eacute;s and 800 Spanish settlers founded the city of St. Augustine in Spanish La Florida. As soon as they were ashore, the landing party celebrated a Mass of Thanksgiving.  The first Thanksgiving was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of <b>Plymouth</b> colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  This year, <b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on Thursday, Nov. 28. Like always, many Americans will gather with loved ones to count life&#39;s blessings and enjoy a meal together in honor of the annual holiday.
