        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving is always Thanksgiving themed word scramble</strong></h2>
        <p>It is a commendable act to thank Allah when something good befalls you. You can express your gratitude to Allah by offering sujud <b>ash</b>-<b>shukr</b> (<b>prostration</b> of thankfulness). Such sajdah (prostration) requires the same conditions required by Salah (ritual Prayers), according to the majority of jurists.  When you say: &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re usually saying it to someone. So, who deserves our thanks, our gratitude, and our praise? Allah says <b>in </b>the Quran, &ldquo;<b>In </b>the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds -&rdquo; [Noble Quran 1:1-2]  The Thanksgiving <b>Prayer</b>. Let us give thanks to the beneficent and merciful God, the Father of our Lord, God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for He has covered us, helped us, guarded us, accepted us to Him, had compassion on us, supported us, and has brought us to this hour.  Our daily <b>Prayers</b>, our fasting during Ramadan, our zakah and Hajj are all our acts of thanksgiving. We should do them not only as duties that must be performed but as our gratitude to our Lord and Creator.  THE <b>PRAYER </b>OF <b>THANKSGIVING</b>. Let us give thanks to the beneficent and merciful God, the Father of our Lord, God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for He has covered us, helped us, guarded us, accepted us unto Him, spared us, supported us, and brought us to this hour.  Each hour is composed of an introduction which includes the Lord&rsquo;s <b>Prayer</b>, the <b>Prayer</b> of Thanksgiving, and Psalm 50. It is followed by various Psalms, an excerpt from the Holy Gospel, and Litanies.  So for Thanksgiving this year, we have a list of duas that you can use with your family and friends to express your gratitude and thankfulness. <b>الْحَمْـدُ</b> <b>للهِ</b> <b>حَمْـداً</b> <b>كَثـيراً</b> <b>طَيِّـباً</b> <b>مُبـارَكاً</b> <b>فيه</b>، <b>غَيْرَ</b> <b>مَكْفِيٍّ</b> وَلا <b>مُوَدَّعٍ</b> وَلا <b>مُسْتَغْـنىً</b> عَنْـهُ رَبُّـنا.  The word for thanksgiving in Arabic is &quot;<b>shukr</b>.&quot; There are two major religious thanksgiving days in Islam: one following the month of fasting [RamaD&acirc;n], and one following the pilgrimage rites in Mecca.  THE <b>PRAYER</b> OF THANKSGIVING . Let us give thanks to the beneficent and merciful God, the Father of our Lord, God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for He has covered us, helped us, guarded us, accepted us unto Him, spared us, supported us, and brought us to this hour. </p>        <p><a href="./34.html">Thanksgiving 5k charlotte nc</a>.
