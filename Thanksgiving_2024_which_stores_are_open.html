        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving 2024 which stores are open Pre cooked thanksgiving dinner san francisco</strong></h2>
        <p>The United <b>States</b> holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast <b>celebrated</b> by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United <b>States</b> <b>celebrated</b> on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United <b>States</b>, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Thanksgiving is a <b>U</b>.<b>S</b>. holiday <b>celebrated</b> each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of Thanksgiving, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  It took the Civil War&mdash;and with it the perceived need for a gesture to build national unity&mdash;for Lincoln to declare a day of thanksgiving for the U.S. in <b>October</b> <b>1863</b>, to be celebrated the following month.  In the United <b>States</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is <b>celebrated</b> on the fourth Thursday in November, as specified in a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1941 and a proclamation issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942.  In 1940 and 1941, FDR <b>celebrated</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the second to last Thursdays in November, while some opponents continued to <b>celebrate</b> it on the last Thursday. To end this confusion and to unify the country as the United <b>States</b> entered World War II, the House and Senate passed a resolution establishing <b>Thanksgiving</b> as the fourth Thursday in ...  The United <b>States</b> celebrates <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a national holiday on the fourth Thursday in November. In 2024, <b>Thanksgiving</b> will be observed on Thursday, November 28. <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year.  It is believed that America&rsquo;s first Thanksgiving, actually a <b>harvest</b> feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668, the holiday was celebrated on November 25, but that lasted only a few years.  Most Americans are familiar with the Pilgrim&#39;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast of 1621, but few realize that it was not the first festival of its kind in North <b>America</b>. Long before Europeans set foot in the Americas, native peoples sought to insure a good harvest with dances and rituals such as the Green Corn Dance of the Cherokees. </p>        <p><a href="./992.html">Thanksgiving teacher letter</a>.
