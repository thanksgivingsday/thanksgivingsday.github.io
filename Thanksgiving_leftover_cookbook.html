        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving leftover cookbook Thanksgiving feast preschool ideas</strong></h2>
        <p>&#39;Buffy The Vampire Slayers&#39; <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>episode</b> is a bit problematic, but also one of the weirdest, farcical and funniest <b>episodes</b> of the entire show.  &quot; Pangs &quot; is the eighth <b>episode</b> of season 4 of the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was written by Jane Espenson, directed by Michael Lange, and first broadcast on November 23, 1999 on The WB.  Buffy&#39;<b>s</b> sole <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>episode</b>, Season 4&#39;s &quot;Pangs&quot;, has an uncomfortable legacy for the show, thanks to its dated attempt at empathy.  <b>Buffy </b>the Vampire Slayer (1997&ndash;2003), created by Joss Whedon, is a television series about <b>Buffy </b>Summers, a teenage girl chosen by fate to battle against vampires, demons, and other supernatural foes.  Meanwhile, Buffy just wants to have <b>Thanksgiving</b> with the people she loves, but she must figure out who Hus is going after next. She also must deal with a &quot;helpless&quot; Spike, who arrives at Giles&#39; apartment seeking help.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer was one of the best-written shows of its time, and there are countless memorable <b>quotes</b> to be found across its seven seasons.  On <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Buffy encounters the spirit of a Native American warrior whose people were wiped out by settlers. It&#39;s Thanksgiving <b>and</b> Buffy <b>pushes</b> Giles to host the gang &#39;as a real American&#39;.  Buffy is upset that her mother is going to be out of town for <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but then decides to cook her own Thanksgiving <b>dinner</b> and invite all their friends. Covered in a blanket and in terrible shape, Spike runs through the woods, trying to escape Riley and his team as they look for him.  Buffy is upset that her mother, Joyce, is going to be out of town for <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but then decides to cook her own Thanksgiving <b>dinner</b> and invite all their friends. Covered in a blanket and in terrible shape, Spike runs through the woods, trying to escape Riley and his team as they look for him. </p>        <p>Funny thanksgiving pick up lines.
