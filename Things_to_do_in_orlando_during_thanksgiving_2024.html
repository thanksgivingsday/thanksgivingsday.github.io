        <h2><strong>Things to do in orlando during thanksgiving 2024 Irs thanksgiving hours</strong></h2>
        <p>When and <b>why</b> has <b>Thanksgiving</b> been observed in <b>Canada</b>? The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> was <b>celebrated</b> in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which was first observed in 1777 and established as a national day of ...  As <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> has historically been <b>celebrated</b> on several different dates, it is fitting that, even though it is observed on Monday, families are equally as likely to <b>celebrate</b> on Saturday or Sunday.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its <b>celebration</b> here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  Celebrating <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> holds deep cultural significance. Pilgrims arriving in Massachusets. <b>Thanksgiving</b> finds its origins in the 17th century. In 1620, a group of religious separatists left England to establish a colony in the New World.  Since 1957, Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been <b>celebrated</b> on the second Monday of October. This change was made to separate the <b>celebration</b> of the harvest from the Remembrance Day commemorations of Canadian War veterans held in November.  <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and American <b>Thanksgiving</b> may look similar at first glance, but there are a a few things that set these two fall festivities apart. Here&#39;s a list of the 4 biggest differences between <b>Canadian</b> and American <b>Thanksgiving</b>!  In the United States, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is <b>celebrated</b> on the fourth Thursday of November but in <b>Canada</b>, it is <b>celebrated</b> on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.). While Americans and Canadians both <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, there are several differences between the traditions and practices in the two neighboring countries.  <b>Canada</b> <b>celebrated</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving movie april.
