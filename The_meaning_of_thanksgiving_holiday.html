        <h2><strong>The meaning of thanksgiving holiday Hyatt savannah thanksgiving lunch</strong></h2>
        <p>When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> eat turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Turkey, corn, and pumpkin pie are all <b>Thanksgiving</b> staples, but what <b>did</b> the <b>pilgrims</b> actually eat <b>at</b> the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>? The answer might surprise you!  Curators at the National Museum of the American Indian call the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> &ldquo;a brunch in the forest,&rdquo; Paul Chaat Smith told the Smithsonian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sidedoor&rdquo; podcast in 2018.  As was the custom in England, the <b>Pilgrims</b> celebrated their harvest with a festival. The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 Wampanoag tribesmen attended the &quot;First Thanksgiving.&quot; The major similarity between the first Jamestown settlers and the first Plymouth settlers was great human suffering.  The attendees of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> were a mixed group, united by survival rather than tradition. Over 90 Wampanoag men, including their leader Massasoit, joined the roughly 50 colonists.  Have you ever wondered what the <b>Pilgrims</b> ate at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  For most people, enjoying turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin for <b>Thanksgiving</b> is as traditional and American as, well, apple pie. But how <b>did</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b> really celebrate...  But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the <b>Pilgrims</b> of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the ...  However, many of the foods we associate with a traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner actually weren&rsquo;t available for the first feast, which stretched for three days. So what foods were served at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? </p>        <p>Thanksgiving printable decorations free. Best online thanksgiving pies. Restaurants open thanksgiving dallas 2024.
