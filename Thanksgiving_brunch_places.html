        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving brunch places Thanksgiving football online live</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>Wampanoag</b> went on to teach their visitors how to hunt, plant crops and how to get the best of their harvest, saving these people, who would go on to be known as the <b>Pilgrims</b>, from starvation, leading to the events of the first Thanksgiving.  The first Thanksgiving in New England, 1621, was the scene on the William Lipscomb School stage Tuesday as fifth-grade pupils wore colorful <b>Pilgrim</b> and Indian costumes. They also collected fruit for another school&rsquo;s pupils. The <b>Pilgrim</b> maid, left, is Barbara Brown, and the two <b>Pilgrim</b> <b>fathers</b> are Gary Hammer, center, and Jimmy May, right.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans...  The <b>Pilgrims</b>, who celebrated the first thanksgiving in America, were fleeing religious persecution in their native England. In 1609 a group of <b>Pilgrims</b> left England for the religious freedom in Holland where they lived and prospered.  The <b>Pilgrims</b> thanked God and their new friends, starting a tradition of thanksgiving that never had a precise date of celebration until president Lincoln. The <b>Pilgrims</b> in fact celebrated thanksgiving in relation to the end of the harvest, between the end of September and the beginning of November.  <b>Pilgrim</b> <b>Fathers</b>, in American colonial history, settlers of Plymouth, Massachusetts, the first permanent colony in New England (1620). Initially referred to as the Old Comers and later the Forefathers, they did not become known as the Pilgrim <b>Fathers</b> until two centuries after their arrival.  Adorned in funny hats, large belt buckles, and clunky black shoes, the <b>Pilgrims</b> of Plymouth gave thanks to God for his blessings, demonstrated by the survival of their fragile settlement.  The first recorded religious Day of Thanksgiving was held in <b>1623</b> in response to a providential rainfall. LATER SIGNIFICANCE OF THANKSGIVING &quot;The Pilgrim Fathers incorporated an early thanksgiving day among [their] moral influences... it blessed and beautified the homes it reached.&quot;  The <b>Pilgrim</b> <b>Fathers</b> could be thankful for mixed success because they viewed every good thing in life&mdash;no matter how small&mdash;as the provision of a sovereign God. </p>        <p><a href="./427.html">Klein soccer club thanksgiving tournament</a>.
