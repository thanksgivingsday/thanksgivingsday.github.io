Stir in onions and <b>pecans</b>. Fill <b>celery</b> with mixture. Note: I cut the corner out of a ziplock bag and use a coupler with a #32 cake decorating tip. This makes filling the celery easier and it looks pretty.  Crisp <b>celery</b> <b>stuffed</b> with a simple and savory mixture of cream cheese and olives. Serve as a low-carb snack or holiday appetizer! In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the cream cheese, green olives, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon a generous amount of filling down the center of each <b>celery</b> piece.  My grandmother taught both me and my mom this appetizer recipe for <b>stuffed</b> <b>celery</b>. We always serve it at Christmas and Thanksgiving. The stuffing is so yummy that even if you don&#39;t normally care for the ingredients on their own, you&#39;ll love the end result.  These Cream Cheese <b>Stuffed</b> <b>Celery</b> bites were not only quick to make but they are pretty healthy and so delicious. They are great to serve ahead of a bigger <b>Thanksgiving</b> or Christmas dinner as they are such light little bites! Difficulty &ndash; This is a really easy recipe to make.  <b>Celery</b> sticks <b>stuffed</b> with a cream cheese and olive mixture. This was on Mom&#39;s table every <b>Thanksgiving</b> and is now a must on mine.  <b>Stuffed</b> <b>celery</b> <b>with</b> cream cheese is a treat in its self. A combination of crunch and cream equals one of the most popular appetizers. Stalks of celery are filled with cream cheese, blue cheese, chopped green olives and pecans.
