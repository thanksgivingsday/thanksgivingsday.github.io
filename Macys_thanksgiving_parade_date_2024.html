        <p><b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, President Lincoln issued a proclamation designating &ldquo;the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving.&rdquo; Lincoln&rsquo;s announcement marked the culmination of a multi-decade campaign by Sarah Josepha Hale to make Thanksgiving into a national holiday.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1789</b>, George Washington issued his Thanksgiving proclamation, designating for &ldquo;the People of the United States a day of public thanks-giving&rdquo; to be held on &ldquo;Thursday the 26th day of November,&rdquo; 1789, marking the first national celebration of a holiday that has become commonplace in today&rsquo;s households.  President George Washington was the first to issue a proclamation for the holiday in 1789, designating <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>26</b> &ldquo;for the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving. &rdquo; This marked the first national celebration of the holiday under the new Constitution.  On <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1789</b>, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November 26, 1789, as an official holiday of &quot;sincere and humble thanks.&quot; The nation then celebrated its first Thanksgiving under its new Constitution.  <b>On</b> <b>June</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1870</b>, President Ulysses S.

Three other holidays included in the law were New Year , Christmas , and July 4.  In 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation making <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>an official</b> annual <b>holiday</b> to be commemorated each year on the last Thursday of November. To stimulate economic recovery, in 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt moved the <b>holiday</b> to the second to the last Thursday of the month to extend the <b>holiday</b> shopping season.  President Zachary Taylor said around <b>1849</b> that it was up to the states to decide when and whether to declare a Thanksgiving holiday; in that period, such a holiday was often celebrated anywhere... </p>        <p>Tufts dining thanksgiving hours.
