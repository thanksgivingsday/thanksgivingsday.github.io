But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on <b>the </b>Mayflower for <b>the </b>&quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by <b>the </b>Wampanoag people.  The first Thanksgiving was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims <b>of</b> <b>Plymouth</b> colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving.
