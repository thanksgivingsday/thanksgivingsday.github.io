        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving canada roots When did canada first celebrate thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>When you take a look at the history of Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b>, you will see that there are some misconceptions on the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and some of the associations with Thanksgiving as we know it to be.  For many Canadian families, <b>Thanksgiving </b>means getting together with family, sharing a meal, and perhaps stressing out about plans. For Indigenous people, the holiday is also one with deep...  The first national Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American Thanksgiving, which was first observed in 1777 and established as a national day of &ldquo;public thanksgiving and prayer&rdquo; in 1789.  In this article I take a brief look at the origins of Thanksgiving and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14th.

The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  TL;DR: This blog post explores the true history of Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b>, revealing how European colonizers adopted Indigenous traditions while perpetuating harm. It traces the origins of Canadian Thanksgiving to Indigenous harvest festivals, emphasizing the Haudenosaunee Confederacy&#39;s influence.  Another difference is the historical context &ndash; Canadian Thanksgiving has its <b>roots</b> in Indigenous traditions and explorers&rsquo; thanksgiving ceremonies, while American Thanksgiving is commonly associated with the historical story of the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving brown university.
