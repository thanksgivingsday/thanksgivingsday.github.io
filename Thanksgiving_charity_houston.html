It draws on the unique, nearly lost history, Of <b>Plymouth</b> <b>Plantation</b>, written by William Bradford, the new colony&rsquo;s governor for more than 30 years, whom the late actor Roger Rees portrays from a script derived from Bradford&rsquo;s book.  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.
