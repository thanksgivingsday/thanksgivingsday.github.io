        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving in canada origin Scholastic first thanksgiving letters</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving </b>is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in October and November in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada that celebrates the blessings of the past year. How did <b>Thanksgiving </b>start? Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests.  Probably the earliest of these acts of <b>thanksgiving </b>was that of Ponce de Leon when he landed in Florida during Easter of 1513. &quot;The first <b>thanksgiving</b>,&quot; as a Pilgrim feast in 1621 subsequently came to be known, was not a religious celebration.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>or <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day had its origins in a harvest festival to thank God for the bounty of the autumn harvest. Celebrated most notably in the United States but also found in many other nations, <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a symbol of the love and joy people feel towards God for the grace and blessings has bestowed on them throughout the year and ...  Thanksgiving Day became an official U.S. holiday <b>in</b> <b>1863</b>, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. A traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  For more than two centuries, days of <b>thanksgiving </b>were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed...  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving </b>can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  Colonists in New England and Canada regularly observed &ldquo;thanksgivings,&rdquo; days of prayer for such blessings as safe journeys, military victories, or abundant harvests. Americans model their holiday on a 1621 harvest feast shared between English colonists and the Wampanoag.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving </b>to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions. </p>        <p><em>Thanksgiving in canada origin</em>. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/409.html">Thanksgiving vidoes for kids</a>.
