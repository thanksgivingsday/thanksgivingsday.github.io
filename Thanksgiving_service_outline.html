        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving service outline Grocery stores open on thanksgiving monday in toronto</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  Thanksgiving is a popular North American holiday that is central to the origin story of the United States. It is traditionally said to have begun with the Plymouth Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, but other Thanksgiving celebrations may have taken place earlier.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as <b>Spanish</b> and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  Learn the history and <b>origin</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, including the symbols related to the holiday and facts about the Presidential Proclamation.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> remains a controversial event and critics argue that it glosses over the brutal conflict faced by Native Americans during the early colonial era. Here is a closer look at the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> as it evolved through American history. </p>        <p><a href="./420.html">Thanksgiving treats with candy</a>. Thanksgiving in maui 2024.
