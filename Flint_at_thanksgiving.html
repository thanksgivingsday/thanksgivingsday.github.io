        <p>The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred on <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.

They say much is missing from the often-told Thanksgiving story.  Museums and historic sites in <b>Plymouth</b> and around the country are telling a more nuanced story about the origins of the holiday&mdash;one that goes far beyond the lasting legend of smiling Pilgrims and... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving with date.
