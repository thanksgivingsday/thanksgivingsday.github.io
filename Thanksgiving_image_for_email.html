        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving image for email Stores open time for black friday</strong></h2>
        <p>As Thanksgiving lurks around the corner, and <b>Christmas</b> decorations are already sprouting about, the holiday season is approaching rapidly which raises the question: which of the two holidays are better, <b>Christmas</b> or Thanksgiving? To answer this as unbiased as possible, I will break down the facts to find out which holiday is objectively better.  All this is to say, there are a lot more moving parts to <b>Christmas</b> than Thanksgiving. It&rsquo;s part of what makes <b>Christmas</b> so exciting, but it&rsquo;s also part of what makes it kind of stressful. <b>Christmas</b>, as much as I love it, can be a little high maintenance. Thanksgiving on the other hand is <b>Christmas</b>&rsquo;s low-key, laidback cousin.  <b>Christmas </b>and <b>Thanksgiving</b>, though distinct in their essence, share a common thread of gratitude and celebration. <b>Thanksgiving</b>, with its crisp autumn air and bountiful feasts, ushers in a season of reflection and appreciation for the harvest&rsquo;s yield and the cherished bonds of family and community.  Thanksgiving is an American holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November, focusing on gratitude and family gatherings. <b>Christmas</b> is a Christian holiday celebrated worldwide on December 25th, commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ.  Is it too early to start celebrating <b>Christmas</b>, or do we need to wait until after Thanksgiving? I feel like there are no people who are in between sides of this argument. Without fail, every year when the clock hits 12:00 am on November 1st, a deeply rooted debate between Americans is brought to the surface.  Thanksgiving is famous for parades, such as the Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> Parade, while <b>Christmas</b> features parades and events but with a focus on Santa Claus and <b>Christmas</b> celebrations. Thanksgiving is mainly celebrated in the U.S. and Canada, while <b>Christmas</b> is celebrated worldwide, even in non-Christian countries.  Key Difference: <b>Christmas </b>or X-mas is a holiday that is celebrated to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ, the son of God. <b>Thanksgiving Day </b>is the <b>day </b>of giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest that has been received for the previous year.  <b>Christmas</b> celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, while Thanksgiving is a day of giving thanks for the harvest and blessings of the past year. Christmas and Thanksgiving are both significant holidays in the United States, celebrated with fervor and joy.  Two of the most celebrated holidays in the United States are Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thanksgiving, celebrated <b>on</b> <b>November</b> <b>23</b>, is a day when families gather together and give thanks for the blessings they have received. </p>        <p>Liquor stores open on thanksgiving oklahoma.
