        <p><b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, during the Civil War, Lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. The holiday was annually proclaimed by every president thereafter, and the date chosen, with few exceptions, was the last Thursday in November.  Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early New England history that have been identified as the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot;, including Pilgrim holidays in Plymouth in <b>1621</b> <b>and</b> <b>1623</b>, and a Puritan holiday in Boston in 1631.

But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  The first Thanksgiving service known to be held by Europeans in North America occurred <b>on</b> <b>May</b> <b>27</b>, <b>1578</b>, in Newfoundland, although earlier Church-type services were probably held by Spaniards in La Florida.  What is the date of the First Thanksgiving? The First Thanksgiving is <b>dated</b> <b>to</b> <b>1621</b>. When did Thanksgiving become an American holiday?
