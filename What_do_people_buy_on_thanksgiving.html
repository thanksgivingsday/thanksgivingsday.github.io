        <h2><strong>What do people buy on thanksgiving Turkey for thanksgiving and christmas</strong></h2>
        <p>&quot;Friends&quot; writer Greg Malins details the mix-up that led to Rachel Green&#39;s (Jennifer Aniston) infamous traditional english meat trifle <b>in</b> the season six Thanksgiving episode, &quot;The One Where Ross...  Rachel is in charge of the <b>Thanksgiving</b> dessert this year, but the cookbook pages are stuck together and Rachel ends up making something that is half <b>trifle</b> half shepherd&rsquo;s pie. Everyone...  I just learned that in the Friends&#39; <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>trifle</b> scene, Matt LeBlanc ate whipped cream and bananas that David Schwimmer had spit out of his mouth.  Season 6 Episode 9: The One Where Ross Got High Stream on MAX https://www.max.com/shows/52dae4c7-2a...

After all, it&#39;s impossible to even think about the game of football ...  Watch Matt LeBlanc explain what really happened behind the scenes during that famous meat <b>trifle</b> scene on &quot;Friends.&quot; Spoiler: It&#39;s gross!  In Season 6, Episode 9 of Friends, titled &ldquo;The One Where Ross Got High,&rdquo; Rachel offers to make a traditional English <b>trifle</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b> dessert. Due to a mix-up in recipe pages, she accidentally combines two recipes&mdash;one for <b>trifle</b> and one for shepherd&rsquo;s pie. The result?  It&rsquo;s pretty amazing to me that after 30 years of being obsessed with &quot;<b>Friends</b>,&quot; there continue to be bits of trivia and behind-the-scenes antics I haven&rsquo;t heard. As one of the best sitcoms of all time, &quot;<b>Friends</b>&quot; delivered hundreds of laughs over the course of a decade, but the stories behind many of those scenes are often just as hilarious. Take &ldquo;The One Where Ross Got High.&rdquo; I just ...  <b>Trifle</b>. Rachel&#39;s botched Thanksgiving dessert is so iconic, they ought to call this episode &quot;The One Where Rachel Makes Trifle.&quot; Backing up, though, Monica hasn&#39;t told her parents that she and ... </p>        <p>Charlie brown explains thanksgiving.
