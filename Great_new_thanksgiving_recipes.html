        <h2><strong>Great new thanksgiving recipes Is the oaks mall open on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Dutch people do <b>celebrate</b> Thanksgiving, in their own way. It&rsquo;s actually not so different than in the US &mdash; an excuse to get together with family and friends for a big meal. But if you&rsquo;re an American, you can still celebrate like a true Yankee (a derivative of the Dutch Jan Kees, of course).  But in Leiden, the connection is still strong enough that every year, on the day of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, people gather in a 900-year old church known as Pieterskerk to <b>celebrate</b> the...  How and when and why <b>do</b> Dutch folk <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? To explore these questions, check out this story from The Dutch Review, &ldquo;Leiden was the key to the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; Also check out a recent 400 year anniversary website about the Pilgrims leaving the <b>Netherlands</b> and landing at what became known as &ldquo;Plymouth Rock&rdquo; in ...  Here are <b>the </b>Dutch public holidays you need to know for 2024 and 2025, as well as other important dates to make a note of on your calendar.  Like in America, the Netherlands observes Thanksgiving on the <b>4th</b> <b>Thursday</b> of <b>November</b>, but instead of a meal, the Dutch attend a non-denominational church service at Pieterskerk, and...  Locals and tourists can find traditional Thanksgiving meals throughout the country on the <b>third</b> <b>Thursday</b> of <b>every</b> <b>November</b>. Restaurants like the Hard Rock Caf&eacute; , as well as several American associations , host traditional meals with turkey, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, gravy, and dressing.  Just to be clear, not ALL Dutch people celebrate Thanksgiving like the United States. Only the ones living in Leiden do so. It turns out that the same Pilgrims that sailed from Plymouth, the United Kingdom in <b>1620</b>, actually lived in Leiden for 10 to 12 years.  The Netherlands have a two-day holiday, called Eerste Paasdag on Sunday and Tweede Paasdag on Monday (lit. First Easter Day and Second Easter Day) If 27 April falls on a Sunday, King&#39;s Day is celebrated on the <b>26th</b>. This is a national holiday, but not a mandatory paid holiday for everyone. [2] .  Every year since <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1574</b>, the city celebrates and commemorates Leiden&rsquo;s relief from the Spanish siege with parades, feasts and a thanksgiving service in Pieterskerk, which the Pilgrims would have experienced while they were living there. </p>        <p>Redneck thanksgiving prayer.
