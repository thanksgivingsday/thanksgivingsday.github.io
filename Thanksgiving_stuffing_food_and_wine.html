        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving stuffing food and wine Bible scripture for thanksgiving day</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on the <b>Mayflower</b> for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 Wampanoag tribesmen attended the <b>&quot;First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&quot; The major similarity between the <b>first</b> Jamestown settlers and the <b>first</b> Plymouth settlers was great human suffering.  For American culture, <b>the </b>story of <b>the </b>Pilgrims, including their &ldquo;<b>first Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with <b>the </b>local Native Americans, has become <b>the </b>ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  Following a successful harvest in the autumn of <b>1621</b>, the colonists decided to celebrate with a three-day festive of prayer. The 53 surviving are said to have eaten with 90 indigenous people in what became known as the first Thanksgiving.  Carrying 101 men, women, and children, the Mayflower traveled the ocean for <b>66</b> days and was supposed to land where New York City is now located. But windy conditions forced the group to cut their...  While no record exists of the first Thanksgiving&rsquo;s exact menu, much of what we know about what happened at the first Thanksgiving comes from <b>Pilgrim</b> <b>chronicler</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Winslow</b>, who wrote:  Myth #2: The first Thanksgiving took place on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> of <b>November</b>, <b>1621</b>. Besides the year, no one knows the actual date of the first Thanksgiving. We know it was a three-day event that started on a Thursday, but no one mentioned the actual date when they wrote about it.  It was <b>the first </b>colonial settlement in New England and was <b>the </b>site of <b>the first Thanksgiving</b>. Plymouth Colony was a British colony in Massachusetts settled by travelers arriving on <b>the</b>...  <b>In</b> <b>1620</b> <b>CE</b> the Mayflower crossed from England to North America. Filled to the brim with passengers, livestock, and supplies, they faced many delays before finally reaching the shores of the New World. </p>        <p>Air and space museum hours thanksgiving. <i>Thanksgiving stuffing food and wine</i>. <a href="./932.html">Is the town center mall open on thanksgiving</a>.
