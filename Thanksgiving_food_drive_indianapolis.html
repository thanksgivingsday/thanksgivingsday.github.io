        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving food drive indianapolis Oven roasted vegetables thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Ronald Reagan </b>1981: &quot;In this spirit, <b>Thanksgiving </b>has become a day when Americans extend a helping hand to the less fortunate. Long before there was a government welfare program, this spirit of voluntary giving was ingrained in the American character.  As we celebrate <b>Thanksgiving </b>in 1981, we should reflect on the full meaning of this day as we enjoy the fellowship that is so much a part of the holiday festivities. Searching our hearts, we should ask what we can do as individuals to demonstrate our gratitude to God for all He has done.  Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, in the spirit and tradition of the Pilgrims, the Continental Congress, and past Presidents, do hereby proclaim <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1985</b>, as a day of national Thanksgiving.  Now, Therefore, I, <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b>, President of the United States of America, in the spirit of George Washington and the Founders, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 27, 1986, as a National Day of Thanksgiving, and I call upon every citizen of this great Nation to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of thanks to affirm ...  Today, cognizant of our American heritage of freedom and opportunity, we are again called to gratitude, <b>thanksgiving</b>, and contrition. <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day summons every American to pause in the midst of activity, however necessary and valuable, to give simple and humble thanks to God.  Here is a sampling of some of the most iconic Ronald Reagan Thanksgiving quotes: &ldquo;<b>Americans</b> have <b>always</b> understood <b>that</b>, <b>truly</b>, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b>. This should be a day of giving as well as a day of thanks.&rdquo;  THANKSGIVING DAY, 1986 &mdash; &ldquo;<b>Today</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>take</b> <b>heart</b> <b>from</b> the noble example of our first President. . . . And let us ever be mindful of the faith and spiritual values that have made our Nation great and that alone can keep us great.&rdquo;  Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim <b>Thursday</b>, <b>November</b> <b>25</b>, 1982, as a National Day of Thanksgiving and I call upon all of our citizens to set aside that day for appropriate expressions of thanksgiving.  Now, Therefore, I, <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b>, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 26, 1987, as a National Day of Thanksgiving, and I call upon the citizens of this great Nation to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of thanks to affirm by their prayers and their gratitude the many ... </p>        <p>Kroger denton tx thanksgiving. <strong>Thanksgiving food drive indianapolis</strong>.
