        <h2><strong>What is open thanksgiving monday burlington Thanksgiving hours sign template</strong></h2>
        <p>In both the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and <b>Canada</b>, Thanksgiving is a holiday to give thanks, enjoy a feast with family, and celebrate a bountiful harvest. But that&rsquo;s where the similarities end. To honour Canadian Thanksgiving in 2022, we look at how <b>Canada</b> does Thanksgiving differently &ndash; from the history and the date to the food and traditions. 1.  This was not a good idea because <b>Canada</b>, which fought for four years, lost a disproportionately large number of soldiers in the trenches, so Nov. 11 is a somber remembrance while Thanksgiving is a ...  Thanksgiving in US vs Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b> . The <b>difference</b> between Thanksgiving in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b> is that in the former country, the festival is celebrated at a different date, and a national holiday is also observed. But on the other hand, in the latter, the date is different as well and no such holiday is ...  Both <b>Canada</b> and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> hold Thanksgiving as a noteworthy national holiday that occurs in the autumn, and in both countries, many people consider it to be an important time for families to gather and enjoy a meal together.

Thanksgiving is one of the biggest holidays of the year in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b>&mdash;with huge parades, massive feasts, and football&mdash;but it&rsquo;s decidedly lower-key in <b>Canada</b>.

As in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b>, <b>Canada</b> observed occasional Thanksgivings to celebrate important events such as the end of the War of 1812. And like its neighbor, <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s first thanksgivings tended to ...  Travel for Thanksgiving Thanksgiving Travel in <b>Canada</b>. Thanksgiving gives us a three-day weekend &ndash; Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. People travel across the country to visit family and friends. Some people use the long weekend to head off on holidays as well. Typically, people gather on Sunday or Monday for their Thanksgiving dinners.  Perhaps the most apparent <b>difference</b> between Canadian and American Thanksgiving is the date. In <b>Canada</b>, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October, while in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b>, it&#39;s observed on the fourth Thursday of November. Why the <b>difference</b>? Well, it&rsquo;s mainly due to the holiday&#39;s different origins.  In general, Canadian Thanksgiving traditional food is fairly similar to that of the U.S. Turkey is usually eaten for Thanksgiving in <b>Canada</b>, though some choose to eat ham, chicken, or other proteins. </p>        <p>Thank you for coming to my birthday party wording.
