        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving corprate greetings Why is thanksgiving on november 24th</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. <b>Americans</b> generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the <b>American</b> people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  <b>American</b> football was in its infancy, but the sport and the <b>Thanksgiving</b> tradition quickly caught on. By 1893, 40,000 spectators showed up to watch the Princeton-Yale <b>Thanksgiving</b> game in New York ...  The colonists of the 17th century declared many days of <b>thanksgiving</b> before and after attacks on Native <b>American</b> villages, especially during King Philip&#39;s War (1675-1678), and this is often cited in the present day by Native <b>American</b> tribes as a reason to observe <b>Thanksgiving</b> through mourning rather than celebration.

A traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  In the modern consciousness, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is strongly associated with the near-mythological story of the Pilgrims at Plymouth (the English colonists) and their Wampanoag Indian neighbors, who shared a meal to celebrate the harvest in 1621. However, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> on a variety of occasions have been celebrated throughout <b>American</b> history.  Many <b>American</b> cities hold road running events, known as &quot;turkey trots&quot;, on <b>Thanksgiving</b> morning, so much so that as of 2018, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is the most popular race day in the <b>U.S</b>. [119] Depending on the organizations involved, these can range from one-mile (1.6 km) fun runs to full marathons (although no races currently use the latter; the ...  The Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade in New York City Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade looking North from the East side of Broadway between 47th &amp; 48th Streets, 1979. Source: Wikimedia Commons As <b>Thanksgiving</b> became more established in the <b>American</b> cultural tradition, <b>Thanksgiving</b> day parades became a popular way to celebrate.  <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which occurs on the fourth Thursday in November, is based on the colonial Pilgrims&#39; 1621 harvest meal.
