        <h2><strong>Whats open and closed on thanksgiving monday Thanksgiving break cms 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of <b>1621</b>.  Ultimately, though, the <b>1621</b> feast would hold little historical relevance to the people involved and was not considered a unique event, since &quot;both the English and Native Americans regularly held ...  In November <b>1621</b>, after the Pilgrims&rsquo; first corn harvest proved successful, Governor William Bradford organized a celebratory feast and invited a group of the fledgling colony&rsquo;s Native American...  In September of <b>1620</b>, 102 pilgrims embarked from England aboard the Mayflower (see Aboard the Mayflower, 1620). Their intent was to establish a settlement in the Hudson River area in the northern reaches of the recently established Virginia Colony.  But the first Thanksgiving <b>in 1621</b>, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  In 1621, these two groups who couldn&rsquo;t speak the same language came together in <b>Patuxet</b>-<b>Plymouth</b> for three days and were working together on diplomacy and forging an alliance.  In Plymouth, Massachusetts, colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared an autumn harvest feast <b>in 1621</b> that is widely acknowledged to be one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations.  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  By autumn of 1621, the <b>Pilgrims</b> had much for which to be thankful. After the harvest, Massasoit and about ninety other Indians joined the Pilgrims for the great English tradition of Harvest Festival. </p>        <p>Friends thanksgiving with brad pitt subtitulado.
