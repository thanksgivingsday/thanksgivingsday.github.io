        <h2><strong>Family thanksgiving traditions and activities Easy carrot thanksgiving recipe</strong></h2>
        <p>Common misconceptions include the belief that the Pilgrims came solely for <b>religious</b> freedom and that the first Thanksgiving resembled modern celebrations, with turkey and pumpkin pie. What impact did the Pilgrims have on American culture?  For such a small band of people &mdash; just 102 people sailed on the Mayflower in 1620, and only about half of them were fleeing <b>religious persecution </b>&mdash; the Pilgrims cast an oversized legacy on American culture today. But their full story is often simplified, if not entirely misunderstood.  The story of the Pilgrims crossing the Atlantic in the Mayflower to escape <b>religious persecution </b>and live freely and independently in North America is commemorated each November as <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day. In 1630, the Pilgrims were followed by four hundred nonseparatist Puritans who sought, in the words of Governor John Winthrop, to establish a ...  From the landing on Plymouth Rock to the harmonious feast with the native Wampanoags, the story about the Pilgrims &mdash; and by extension, the story of <b>Thanksgiving </b>&mdash; is rife with myth and...  A small band of <b>religious</b> fundamentalists flee <b>persecution</b> in Europe, hoping to create a more godly society in the New World. But devastating difficulties await them in North America.  The Pilgrims, who celebrated the first <b>thanksgiving </b>in America, were fleeing <b>religious persecution </b>in their native England. In 1609 a group of Pilgrims left England for the <b>religious </b>freedom in Holland where they lived and prospered.  When the Pilgrims set sail from Europe in 1620, several powerful reasons propelled them across the Atlantic Ocean to make new lives in America&mdash;but <b>religious</b> liberty was not their most pressing...  Many imagine that the Pilgrims left the Old World behind to worship as they pleased and start a new country imbued with <b>religious</b> freedom, an ideal later codified in the First Amendment. Nothing could be further from the truth.  It has been widely taught &mdash; and widely believed &mdash; that the first Thanksgiving took place circa <b>October</b> <b>1621</b>. A group of English Pilgrims, Puritans, had migrated to escape religious persecution. These were members of a rather radical separatist church that found the Church of England corrupt. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving car travel boston. Thanksgiving day 2 13.
