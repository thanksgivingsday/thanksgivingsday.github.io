        <p>If someone at your Thanksgiving gathering likes white wine with a touch of vanilla-flavored oak, look <b>to</b> <b>Three</b> <b>Coins</b> <b>Knights</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>2011</b> <b>Viognier</b> (<b>$26</b>), which adds a honeyed character balanced by pleasantly tart fruit.  These are the best white wines for Thanksgiving. <b>Viognier</b>: Floral and fruity, with essences of peach, apricot, and pear. Low acidity. Chenin Blanc: Spicy and slightly sweet with high acidity. Sauvignon Blanc: Light and crisp, with grassy or herbaceous flavors. Higher acidity makes this a good wine for Thanksgiving. Riesling: Can be dry or sweet.  Consider this your official <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>wine</b> pairings cheat sheet. With these tempting food and drink pairings, your <b>Thanksgiving</b> is sure to be guaranteed touchdown. The Best <b>Wine</b> to Pair with Turkey: Domaine Chante Cigale 2020 White (Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape)  If you don&rsquo;t particularly love Pinot Noir, or you know Aunt Christine prefers white <b>wine</b>, opt instead for a dry Riesling or ros&eacute;, or even a sparkling wine.  From Pinot Noir to Cabernet Franc and Pinot Gris, these <b>Thanksgiving</b> wines will make a great addition to your meal. This is the best <b>wine</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b>, including red wines and white...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> often means a slice of classic pumpkin, apple or pecan pie to round out the meal. Koffer suggests pairing your pie with a dessert <b>wine</b> made from white grapes. The key is to balance the dessert&rsquo;s sweetness with the chosen <b>wine</b>. Sweet Sparkling recommendation: Moscato d&rsquo;Asti  This IGT white is made around Taranto in Puglia without aging in <b>oak</b> so that it&rsquo;s clean. Refreshingly dry and citrusy, with pretty floral bouquet. HAHN PINOT NOIR 2023 ($16).  4. The Best White <b>Wine</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b> Dinner. When it comes to the best <b>wine</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, nothing beats a glass of dry Riesling. Bright acidity tingles through all the fat in the gravy, stuffing, potatos, yams and the richness of spice in cranberry sauce.  Some safe bets for <b>Thanksgiving</b> wines are pinot noir, syrah, and zinfandel for red <b>wine</b> lovers, and sauvignon blanc, riesling, gew&uuml;rztraminer, and viognier for those who prefer white wines. Riesling: This white <b>wine</b> can either be quite dry or fairly sweet, and it&#39;s excellent with spicy, salty, or sweet foods. </p>        <p>Newark ny thanksgiving day run. <a href="./198.html">The first thanksgiving vocabulary quiz</a>.
