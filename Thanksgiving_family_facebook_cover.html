As in many other countries, Easter Sunday and Whitsunday are not public holidays, as they fall on a Sunday anyway.  In <b>Sweden</b>, there is a difference between public holidays, which are often called &lsquo;red days&rsquo;, and non-working days (free days). There are 13 Swedish public holidays in the year. Employees at most workplaces are generally free on public holidays, but many are free on other days.  In <b>Sweden</b>, public holidays are colloquially referred to as &#39;red days&#39;. Here are all the public holidays in Sweden in 2024.  In this blog, I will tell you where you can find all the right ingredients to commemorate <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Sweden</b>, which recipe to follow for the best-roasted turkey, and finally how you can adapt some old traditions in a new country.  Although seasonal holidays are observed in <b>Sweden</b>, paid time off is discretionary. These celebrations include March Equinox, June Solstice, September Equinox and December Solstice. All holidays and annual vacations are regulated by <b>Sweden</b>&rsquo;s Annual Leave Act, which pertains to all employees. </p>        <p><a href="./259.html">Cub foods minnetonka thanksgiving hours</a>.
