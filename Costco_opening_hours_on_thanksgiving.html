        <p>Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> Thursday of <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated on Thursday, Nov. 28 this year, and as the <b>holiday</b> quickly approaches many are left wondering: When was the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? What were the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day ...

The United States <b>holiday</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.

Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday celebrated on various dates <b>in</b> <b>October</b> <b>and</b> <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. </p>        <p>Heb rewarming pumpkin pie for thanksgiving.
