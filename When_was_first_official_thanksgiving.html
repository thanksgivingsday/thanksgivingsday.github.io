        <p>Ruth Hopkins, a Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer, biologist, attorney, and former tribal judge, breaks down the <b>myths</b> and facts about <b>Thanksgiving</b> and early encounters between Pilgrims and the Wampanoag.  <b>Myth</b>: The <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Was in 1621. The origin story of <b>Thanksgiving</b> details how the Mayflower left Plymouth, England, in September 1620 and arrived near Cape Cod two months later, after which time passengers established a settlement at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts.  The <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many <b>myths</b> surround the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.

There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack with this one, and not just because it forms the basis of our country&rsquo;s ...  But it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the harmful consequences that the <b>myth</b> of the <b>first Thanksgiving</b> has had, especially on Native American communities. The mythical story behind the holiday has led to a misrepresentation of the relationship between Native Americans and the Pilgrims &mdash; which some assume was totally harmonious.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> facts and <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>myths</b> have blended together for years like so much gravy and mashed potatoes, and separating them is just as complicated. ... claiming it was the &ldquo;<b>first</b> ... </p>        <p>Sight word pre primer coloring sheets thanksgiving free.
