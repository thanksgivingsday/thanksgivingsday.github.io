        <h2><strong>Why do we give thanksgiving to god Restaurants that are open during thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The first Thanksgiving celebrated by European settlers in North America took place in <b>1578</b> in what is now <b>Nunavut</b>. The settlers ate a meal to celebrate and give thanks for their safe arrival after their trip across the ocean.  The first Thanksgiving after Confederation was observed <b>on</b> 5 April <b>1872</b>, a national civic holiday rather than a religious one. Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in Canada on 6 November 1879.  English explorer Martin Frobisher hosted the <b>first</b> Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b>. It was held in what is now Newfoundland during his expedition&#39;s attempts to find the Northwest Passage to the Orient in 1578 and marked their safe arrival to the New World.  Canada was the <b>first</b> country in North America to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In fact, the Indigenous Peoples of Canada have been having annual fall harvest <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations for hundreds of years prior to the arrival of European settlers.  Canada celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> and American <b>Thanksgiving</b> may look similar at <b>first</b> glance, but there are a a few things that set these two fall festivities apart. Here&#39;s a list of the 4 biggest differences between Canadian and American <b>Thanksgiving</b>!  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or Thanksgiving Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  The first Thanksgiving in Canada has been credited to English <b>explorer</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b>. According to historical records, he celebrated in 1578 in what we now know as Newfoundland. The first official Thanksgiving was celebrated on Nov. 6, 1879. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving crafts for boys. Etsy thanksgiving napkins. Merrick park thanksgiving hours. Excel thanksgiving date.
