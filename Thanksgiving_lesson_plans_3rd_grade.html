        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving lesson plans 3rd grade Animated thanksgiving background</strong></h2>
        <p>Because <b>Thanksgiving</b> fell late that year, businesses were concerned that the Christmas shopping season would be cut short. Store owners had already been seeing poor sales due to the Great Depression, so they lobbied FDR to <b>move</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> up a week. FDR was not swayed that year, but in 1939, there were once again five Thursday in November.  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  The colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of <b>thanksgiving</b> for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.  According to the National Archives, the last Thursday in November fell on the last day of the month in 1939, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved that <b>year</b>&#39;<b>s</b> Thanksgiving <b>to</b> the...  Congress officially moved Thanksgiving back to the fourth Thursday of November in <b>1941</b>, where it has remained ever since.  But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, <b>moved</b> that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms. A Congressional Joint Committee approved the motion, and informed President George Washington.  When Franklin Roosevelt first became president in 1933, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was still not a fixed holiday, but left up to the President to issue a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Proclamation to declare the date the holiday would fall on that year.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  It is believed that America&rsquo;s first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668, the holiday was celebrated on November 25, but that lasted only a few years. </p>        <p>Restaurants serving thanksgiving dinner in bucks county pa.
