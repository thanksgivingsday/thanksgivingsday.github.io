        <h2><strong>What year was the 1st thanksgiving celebrated Winter break aldine isd</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  In 1941, a Congressional Joint Resolution officially set the fourth Thursday <b>of</b> <b>November</b> as a national holiday for Thanksgiving. Today, Thanksgiving is a time when many families come together, and many churches are open for special services.  Museums and historic sites in <b>Plymouth</b> and around the country are telling a more nuanced story about the origins of the holiday&mdash;one that goes far beyond the lasting legend of smiling Pilgrims...

Thanksgiving is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b>. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  That&#39;s why many Native Americans and others mark <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a solemn day of remembrance instead of celebration. Here&#39;s what really went down after the plates were cleared in Plymouth, Mass...  <b>Thanksgiving</b>, with its cozy family gatherings, mountains of mashed potatoes, and endless slices of pie, is a holiday cherished by many. But few know the full story behind its creation as a national holiday. It didn&rsquo;t start with a single official declaration or a neat historical moment.  Here&#39;s a bit of history about <b>Thanksgiving</b> and traditions surrounding the <b>holiday</b>. Who attended the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day &quot;celebration&quot; is said to have taken place in 1621 ...  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>. </p>        <p>Good eats thanksgiving episode.
