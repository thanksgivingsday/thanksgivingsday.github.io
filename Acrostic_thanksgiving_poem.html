        <h2><strong>Acrostic thanksgiving poem All recipes thanksgiving menu</strong></h2>
        <p>In the end, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated on <b>two</b> different dates that <b>year</b>. At the beginning of Roosevelt&rsquo;s presidency, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was not a fixed holiday; it was up to the President to issue a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Proclamation to announce on what date the holiday would fall.  In 1939, to lengthen the Christmas shopping season, Franklin Roosevelt ordered Thanksgiving moved from the last Thursday in November to the second to last. Many states refused to acknowledge &ldquo;<b>Franksgiving</b>,&rdquo; causing Thanksgiving to be celebrated twice a year for two years in the U.S.  Eighty years ago, a holiday quirk occurred. The <b>year</b> 1939 featured not <b>one</b>, but <b>two</b>, <b>Thanksgivings</b>. President Franklin Roosevelt was busy trying to both drag the country out of the Great Depression and to prepare the nation for the war clouds gathering on the horizon.  Back in 1863, President Lincoln proclaimed <b>Thanksgiving</b> should occur on the last Thursday in November, according to the Saturday Evening Post. And that&#39;s the way it was until 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt made the momentous and controversial decision to move it.  &ldquo;The senate and House of Representatives of the United States have by a joint resolution signified their desire that a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity as a day of <b>thanksgiving</b> and of devout acknowledgments to Almighty God for His great goodness manifested in restoring to them ...  Because <b>Thanksgiving</b> is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, the date varies from <b>year</b> to <b>year</b>. The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot; The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.  They asked Franklin <b>Roosevelt</b> to make Thanksgiving one week earlier. President Roosevelt ignored those concerns in 1933, but when Thanksgiving once again threatened to fall on the last day of November in 1939, FDR reconsidered the request and moved the date of Thanksgiving up one week.  James Madison declared Thanksgiving twice <b>in </b>1815. None of these were celebrated <b>in </b>the autumn. The next national Thanksgiving was declared only <b>in </b>April 1862, by Abraham Lincoln. <b>In </b>1863, he declared Thanksgiving for 6 August, and for the last Thursday <b>in </b>November.  The <b>Year</b> of <b>Two</b> <b>Thanksgivings</b> With all the concerns about Christmas &mdash; or at least Christmas shopping &mdash; intruding on Thanksgiving, maybe it&rsquo;s time to keep Thanksgiving in its traditional pre-1939 place. </p>        <p>Autozone nj thanksgiving hours.
