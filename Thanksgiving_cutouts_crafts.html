        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving cutouts crafts Restaurants open on thanksgiving 2024 colorado springs</strong></h2>
        <p>Canadians have been celebrating Thanksgiving day as an official statutory holiday since 1879. The dates were not fixed as some provinces celebrated it in October and some in <b>November</b>.  Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated on the second Monday <b>of</b> <b>October</b> every year. This corresponds to October <b>14</b>, <b>2024</b>. Canadian Thanksgiving has a rich history and story behind it that is not rooted in the American celebration.  Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>October</b>, while Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. When is Thanksgiving in Canada? In 2025, Thanksgiving in Canada is Monday, October 13.  Canadian Thanksgiving is celebrated on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> <b>October</b> and is an official statutory holiday, except in Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. In Nova Scotia, Thanksgiving is a Designated Retail Closing Day.  Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in Canada <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>. The date for each of the following years, as well as a unifying theme for which to give thanks (usually concerning the harvest, though anniversaries related to the British monarchy were also common), was determined annually by Parliament.  Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> is in October&mdash;and on a Monday. That&rsquo;s right! Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> happens a full month and a half before American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, on the second Monday in October (Monday, October 14, 2024).  Since 1957, Thanksgiving Day has been a holiday in Canada on the <b>second</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>of</b> <b>October</b>. Canadian Thanksgiving is a chance for people to give thanks for fortunes in the past year, including a good harvest. Below, we will explain what people do on Canadian Thanksgiving, as well as the ways that it differs from U.S. Thanksgiving.  What&#39;s the difference between Thanksgiving in America and Thanksgiving in Canada? In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>of</b> <b>November</b> but in Canada, it is celebrated on the second Monday in October (which is Columbus Day in the U.S.).  While the actual Thanksgiving holiday is on <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b>, Canadians may gather for their Thanksgiving feast on any day during the long weekend; however, Sunday is considered the most common. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving week in dc.
