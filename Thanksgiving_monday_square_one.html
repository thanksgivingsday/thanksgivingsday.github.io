        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving monday square one Hilton waikoloa village thanksgiving dinner</strong></h2>
        <p>While <b>Thanksgiving</b> wasn&#39;t declared a national holiday in Canada until 1879, the <b>first</b> <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is recognized as happening as far back as 1578. English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew were looking for a Northwest Passage, and after a series of storms in the Arctic, the fleet <b>came</b> back together in what is now Newfoundland, Canada.  Many of the trappings of Canadian Thanksgiving are similar to those of its U.S. counterpart, but the Canadian tradition belongs to the <b>16th</b> <b>century</b>, more than four decades before the historic...  The <b>first</b> <b>American</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated 43 years later in 1621 at the site of Plymouth Plantation, in Massachusetts. The Wampanoag Native Americans helped the pilgrims who arrived in Massachusetts cultivate the land and fish, saving them from starvation.  It has become common knowledge that the first Thanksgiving in North America was held <b>by</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Frobisher</b> and his crew in Nunavut in 1578. There are those &mdash; mainly Americans upset by the thought of having their holiday co-opted &mdash; who argue that it wasn&#39;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Thanksgiving.  This is now accepted as the first &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; Thanksgiving, forty-three years before the first &ldquo;American&rdquo; Thanksgiving. Forty-eight years later on November <b>14</b>, <b>1606</b>, inhabitants of New France under Samuel de Champlain held huge feasts of thanksgiving between local Mi&rsquo;kmaq and the French.  In Canada, the celebration draws from three traditions: European harvest traditions, Martin <b>Frobisher</b>&#39;<b>s</b> <b>1578</b> Thanksgiving in the Eastern Arctic, which is the first North American celebration by that name, and the 1621 Thanksgiving of the Pilgrims on occasion of their first harvest.  American and Canadian Thanksgiving Have Different (But Similar) Origins. Everyone seems to know the story of the first American Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, but do you know how Canadian Thanksgiving came about? In fact, the first Canadian Thanksgiving may have even pre-dated the Pilgrims&rsquo; big meal.  Those of us from the United States might think we hold the patent on the concept of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Indeed, the November observance is one of the two biggest quintessential U.S. holidays. (The Fourth of July is the other.) But the idea is by no means unique, nor did the iconic 1621 gathering of Pilgrims and Native Americans <b>come</b> <b>first</b>.  This was 17 years before what is often recognized as the <b>first</b> <b>American</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> &mdash; the Pilgrims&rsquo; celebration of their <b>first</b> harvest in Massachusetts in 1621 (which was actually predated by several similar events in the New England colonies by at least 14 years). </p>        <p>Thanksgiving restaurant austin tx. <a href="./594.html">Thanksgiving printable sign</a>.
