        <p>A Holiday is Made <b>Thanksgiving</b> today may have little connection with the Plymouth harvest festival 400 years ago, but it has a long <b>history</b> nevertheless. Originally a regional observance in colonial New England, <b>Thanksgiving</b> began as a solemn affair. Rather than a day of feasting, it was a day for fasting and quiet reflection.  The Wampanoag people do not share in the popular reverence for the traditional New England <b>Thanksgiving</b>. For them, the holiday is a reminder of betrayal and bloodshed. Since 1970, many native people have gathered at the statue of Massasoit in Plymouth, Massachusetts, each <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day to remember their ancestors and the strength of the ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, and more.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  It is intended to celebrate the blessings of the past year. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day became an official U.S. holiday in 1863, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as <b>Thanksgiving</b>. A traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is popularly modeled on a romanticized view of the Pilgrims of Plimouth Colony in Massachusetts in the 1620s. The story tends to go that they held a feast to thank both the Native Americans who had helped them survive through the winter and God whom they believed had led them to the New World.  Hale wrote a similar letter to Secretary of State William Seward, who may have been the one to convince Lincoln it was a good <b>idea</b>.
