Abraham Lincoln began the tradition of an annual national Thanksgiving in 1863. Thanksgiving is an enduring symbol from which millions of immigrants have learned &quot;Americanism.&quot; While not all Native Peoples celebrate the day, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag sharing a harvest celebration remains an inspiration to many.

The first Thanksgiving in New England, 1621, was the scene on the William Lipscomb School stage Tuesday as fifth-grade pupils wore colorful <b>Pilgrim</b> and Indian costumes. They also collected fruit for another school&rsquo;s pupils. The <b>Pilgrim</b> maid, left, is Barbara Brown, and the two <b>Pilgrim</b> <b>fathers</b> are Gary Hammer, center, and Jimmy May, right. </p>        <p><a href="./989.html">Walmart hours thanksgiving black friday</a>.
