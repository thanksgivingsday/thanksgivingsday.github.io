        <h2><strong>Downtown cda restaurants open thanksgiving 2024 Cauliflower side dish for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Where is <b>Thanksgiving</b> mentioned and what does it mean in the Bible? Why is thankfulness important?  Here are seven key things Jesus and his disciples taught us about gratefulness and giving thanks. Photo credit: &copy;Getty Images/Tonktiti. 1. Jesus Taught about Gratitude for <b>Daily</b> <b>Needs</b>, Like Food. As part man, part God, Jesus is our perfect example of how to live. As the apostle John said, in Jesus, &ldquo;Word became flesh&rdquo; (John 1:14).  Jesus often shared gratitude and thanksgiving in His ministry, showing us the importance of appreciating God&rsquo;s <b>faithfulness</b>. Through key events, such as feeding the multitude and during the Last Supper, His actions highlighted the significance of thanksgiving in profound moments.  <b>Jesus</b> Christ, my Lord, and God, I give thanks for your loving-kindness and all the blessings You have richly bestowed upon me. I fall down in worship and adoration before You, the King of Glory.  Here are nine things you should know about the holiday (and the attitude) of <b>Thanksgiving</b>: 1. The Pilgrims who traveled on the Mayflower and landed on Cape Cod were not the first Americans to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The &ldquo;Feast of the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; was held in 1598 near El Paso, Texas&mdash;23 years before the Pilgrims&rsquo; festival.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> begins with acknowledging God as faithful, earnestly giving Him thanks, in advance, for His abundant blessings. Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ <b>Jesus</b> for you. (1 Thessalonians 5:18) Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever! (Psalm 107:1)  <b>Jesus</b> is not only God himself but also the quintessentially thankful human. The God-man not only died to forgive our failures in giving God the thanks he&rsquo;s due, but also lived the perfect life of appreciation on our behalf toward his Father.  Thanksgiving is <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of <b>our</b> <b>prayers</b>. Some of the most remembered passages on the giving of thanks are the following: &quot;Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, NKJV).  The Revised Common Lectionary gives Scriptures to be read for Thanksgiving: <b>Deuteronomy</b> <b>26:1</b>-<b>11</b>, which is about bringing firstfruits and tithes; Psalm 100 which is a short psalm for giving grateful praise; Philippians 4:4-9 which is about rejoicing; and John 6:25-35 where Jesus refers to himself as the Bread of Life. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving morning candle.
