        <p>Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the <b>1621</b> harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623. On this occasion,...  Today&rsquo;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes. However, the very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> most likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge and venison.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal.

The <b>feast</b> featured autumnal foods native to Massachusetts.  <b>In</b> <b>1621</b>, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the...
