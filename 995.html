        <h2><strong>Is the first thanksgiving a myth Thanksgiving greetings for the man you love</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Myth</b>: The Pilgrims were the <b>first</b> Europeans to land in Southern New England and to interact with the Native people. ... the feast that would serve as the basis of the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>myth</b> ...  Popular American folklore suggests the &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; was <b>an</b> <b>idyllic</b> <b>feast</b>.

Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  The <b>myth</b> of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> often attaches modern day <b>Thanksgiving</b> foods to the 1621 event. Turkey is commonly portrayed as a centerpiece of the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal, although it is not mentioned in primary sources, [ 5 ] and historian Godfrey Hodgson suggests turkey would have been rare in New England at the time and difficult for ... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving restaurants sarasota.
