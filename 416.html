        <h2><strong>What to do in philadelphia thanksgiving Happy thanksgiving in the country</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> 2024 Week <b>in Philadelphia</b> will be all crazy with all the places to go and things to <b>do</b> during this time. From the delicious <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner <b>in Philadelphia</b> to some refreshing <b>Thanksgiving</b> yoga classes, there&rsquo;s a lot that will catch your attention. Explore some of the best <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2024 events <b>in Philadelphia</b> and get going to places that suit you best.  The turkey-filled holiday is almost here, and that means the annual <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade will be in full swing this Thursday, Nov. 28. The event &mdash; which happens to be the oldest of its kind in the country &mdash; takes over the Ben Franklin Parkway, and is free and open to the public.  The Comcast Holiday Spectacular returns and opens on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day! Every year, this 15-minute festive musical fills the Comcast Center lobby with holiday songs, expansive aerial footage of <b>Philadelphia</b>, parts of the Pennsylvania Ballet&rsquo;s The Nutcracker, and more on one of the world&rsquo;s largest highest-resolution LED displays. This year ...  The long <b>Thanksgiving</b> weekend is stuffed with events and happenings. ðŸ¦ƒ The <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade steps off at 9am from 20th Street and JFK Boulevard en route to the <b>Philadelphia</b> Museum of Art. Plan for floats, special performances and guests that include &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot; star Lisa Ann Walter.  Christmas Village <b>in Philadelphia</b>. November 23rd, 10 am-5 pm Love Park and City Hall. Running for its 16th season, Christmas Village <b>in Philadelphia</b> will transform LOVE Park and City Hall&rsquo;s Courtyard and North Broad Street into an authentic German Christmas Market. The event is free to attend and will run from November 18th through Christmas Eve.  The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Parade traces its launch back 1920. It was conceptualized and sponsored by the Gimbels Department Store, which organized floats, balloons, and high school marching bands for the inaugural edition. The goal was to stimulate interest in the Christmas shopping season, which always started the day after <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  A number of the season&rsquo;s fabulous holiday attractions also open for the season over <b>Thanksgiving</b> weekend, including the riverside oasis Independence Blue Cross RiverRink Winterfest, toy-train wonderland Holiday Garden Railway and The Nighttime Express at Morris Arboretum &amp; Gardens, iconic Macy&rsquo;s Christmas Light Show and Dickens Christmas Village, and new-for-2024 Yuletide at Liberty Hill.  The longest-running <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day parade in the country, the 6abc Dunkin&rsquo; <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Parade soars over Center City for its 105th year.. A beloved <b>Philadelphia</b> tradition, the annual procession of extravagant floats, charming balloons and musical performances delight paradegoers up and down the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, all leading up to the arrival of a very special guest of honor.  <b>Philadelphia</b> 76ers. The 76ers are off to an extremely rough start to the season. The team is dealing with injuries and can&rsquo;t seem to put the pieces together on offense, despite a strong start from rookie Jared McCain. The Sixers have three home games over <b>Thanksgiving</b> break and tickets are available online. </p>        <p>Trc pella thanksgiving service. <a href="./519.html">Free thanksgiving turkey deals</a>.
