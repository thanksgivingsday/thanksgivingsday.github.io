        <h2><strong>Who made the rule for thanksgiving Recetas de arroz para thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Norman <b>Rockwell</b>&rsquo;s Freedom From Want is one of the most iconic (and parodied) paintings of the 20th century&mdash;it&rsquo;s the Thanksgiving painting we know without even necessarily knowing its name.  Examining this painting, we see a large <b>family</b> gathered around their <b>table</b> for a feast. We presume the occaison is Thanksgiving because of the huge turkey being served. Both the good china and the good silver are on the <b>table</b>.  It is a picture that has come to be synonymous with Thanksgiving and happens to be one of Norman <b>Rockwell</b>&rsquo;s most famous paintings. Here&rsquo;s a look at the history of that painting and how it changed people&rsquo;s opinion about the U.S.&rsquo;s involvement in World War II.  Three generations circle the food&mdash;a nuclear <b>family</b> more rarely seen today, but still existing in some hearts and minds as an ideal. From the lower right corner, in the finest Renaissance tradition of painting, a young man looks out at you directly&mdash;the classic challenge to the viewer posed by the painter and his painting.  Freedom from Want depicted friends and <b>family</b> of Norman <b>Rockwell</b> at the Thanksgiving <b>table</b>; the work first appeared in the Saturday Evening Post on March 6, 1943. But Freedom from Want is...  In Freedom from Want, a large <b>family</b> gathered together for dinner, their silhouettes surrounding the <b>table</b>, framing the food and pristine tableware. The <b>table</b> takes up roughly two thirds of the painting, placing the horizon to the upper third.  The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner <b>table</b> for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation for Americans of the Thanksgiving holiday and <b>family</b> holiday gatherings in general.  <b>Rockwell</b>&rsquo;s painting stages the <b>family</b> surrounding the <b>table</b>, forming a frame around the plentiful food and meticulously arranged tableware. <b>Family</b> members are brimming with energy and anticipation, and we are drawn into the scene by the cropped man on the bottom right corner, whose smiling eyes meet ours.  Many artists have used Norman <b>Rockwell</b>&rsquo;s Freedom of Want as inspiration for creating their own images which tell their stories of family, Thanksgiving <b>and</b> <b>connectedness</b>.
