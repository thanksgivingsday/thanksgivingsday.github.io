        <h2><strong>Facts thanksgiving turkeys Happy thanksgiving day parade 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>While today the traditional meat served on Thanksgiving is turkey, historians agree it probably wasn&#39;t present in the <b>1621</b> <b>feast</b> shared between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe. The Wampanoag brought deer, while the Pilgrims provided &quot;fowl,&quot; which was likely ducks or geese.  How did the <b>turkey</b> become a popular <b>Thanksgiving</b> centerpiece? Did the Pilgrims eat <b>turkey</b>? What about pumpkin pie? See how foods differed from today&mdash;and some historically inspired recipes, too!  How <b>did</b> <b>turkey</b> become the centerpiece of this feast? It is often assumed that today&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu originated in an event commonly referred to as the &ldquo;<b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; There is indeed evidence of a meal shared between Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth colony (in what is now Massachusetts) and Wampanoag people in late 1621.  WASHINGTON &mdash; When <b>we</b> think of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>we</b> often picture steaming plates of <b>turkey</b>, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the ...  In 1789, George Washington issued a Thanksgiving Proclamation asking all citizens to give thanks together as a country on <b>November</b> <b>26</b>. It may be because of this first official celebration and a remark supposedly made by Alexander Hamilton that turkey is the traditional food for Thanksgiving.  In <b>1621</b>, pilgrims from England celebrated their autumnal harvest in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and they were joined by members of the Wampanoag tribe. (About 200 years later, this was retroactively designated the &quot;first Thanksgiving,&quot; though the participants likely just thought of it as a run-of-the-mill fall gathering.)  In fact, the event we now think of as The First Thanksgiving may not have had any turkey at all. It&rsquo;s true that the Pilgrims shared a meal with the Wampanoag Indians at Plymouth Colony <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>. But all we know for sure about the menu is that it included deer and &ldquo;fowl.&rdquo;  <b>Turkey</b> or no <b>turkey</b>, the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>&rsquo;s attendees almost certainly got their fill of meat. Winslow wrote that the Wampanoag arrived with an offering of five deer.  While turkey was likely present at the first Thanksgiving, it wasn&rsquo;t the centerpiece of the meal like it is today. That happened in the <b>late</b> <b>1800s</b>, around the time when President Lincoln made... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner food images. Thanksgiving 2024 in japan.
