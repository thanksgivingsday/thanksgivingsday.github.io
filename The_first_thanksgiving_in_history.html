        <p>The holiday moved away from its religious roots to allow immigrants of every background to participate in a common <b>tradition</b>. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day football games, beginning with Yale versus Princeton in 1876, enabled fans to add some rowdiness to the holiday. In the late 1800s parades of costumed revelers became common.  Each year Americans in the United States celebrate the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday on the fourth Thursday of November. Most families follow traditions begun on the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but many have their own traditions that they follow each year.

The legend of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday is said to have been based on a feast of <b>thanksgiving</b> in the early days of the American colonies almost 400 years ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became an American national holiday.  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the <b>tradition</b> it is today.
