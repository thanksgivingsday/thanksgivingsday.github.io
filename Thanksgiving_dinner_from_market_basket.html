        <p>So, maybe you aren&rsquo;t required to give employees the day off on those federally-recognized holidays. But, if you have them work, do you need to pay them more? In most <b>cases</b>, <b>no</b>. &zwj; Again, federal employees should have the day off and be paid for it. &zwj;  <b>Day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Among civilian workers who received paid holidays, 43 percent received the <b>Day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> as a paid holiday, with 39 percent of private industry workers and 69 percent of state and local government workers receiving the holiday.  The following holidays are observed by the majority of US businesses with paid time <b>off</b>: New Year&#39;s <b>Day</b>, New Year&#39;s Eve, [ 2 ] Memorial <b>Day</b>, Independence <b>Day</b>, Labor <b>Day</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b>, the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> known as Black Friday, Christmas Eve and Christmas. There are also numerous holidays on the state and local level that are observed to varying degrees.  In the U.S., typical paid holidays include New Year&#39;s <b>Day</b>, Memorial <b>Day</b>, Independence <b>Day</b>, Labor <b>Day</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>, and Christmas <b>Day</b>, but these generally differ depending on the employer and job sector.  Although not required, about 96% of all U.S. businesses honor these holidays by giving employees paid time <b>off</b> (PTO). These holidays are New Year&#39;s <b>Day</b>, Memorial <b>Day</b>, Independence <b>Day</b>, Labor <b>Day</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>, and Christmas. Similar to business holidays, federal employees also observe federal holidays.  The day after Thanksgiving (or Black Friday) has been recognized as a state holiday in <b>about</b> 20 US states. Even though it&rsquo;s not a federal holiday by itself, many private businesses and state government institutions give an additional day off which allows employees to plan an extended holiday.  Employees at <b>70</b> <b>percent</b> of the companies surveyed will get Thanksgiving and the next day off with pay, the survey found. That figure is almost unchanged from 1999 (68 percent) and 1998 (71...  When is <b>Day after Thanksgiving</b>? Celebrated on the Friday <b>after</b> the fourth Thursday in November in the United States, The <b>Day after Thanksgiving</b> is not a federal holiday but is a holiday in almost half the states in the U.S. and is given as a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> by <b>most</b> employers.  When a holiday is on a Saturday or Sunday, consider offering the first Monday <b>off</b>, as in the Monday right <b>after</b> that weekend. Or if a holiday falls on another non-workday for your <b>company</b>, if not the weekend, consider offering the preceding or following workday <b>off</b>. </p>        <p>Printable images for thanksgiving feast.
