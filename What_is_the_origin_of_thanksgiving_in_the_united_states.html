        <h2><strong>What is the origin of thanksgiving in the united states We will close on thanksgiving open on friday</strong></h2>
        <p>The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  Pilgrim <b>leader</b> William Bradford aboard the Mayflower. Credit: MPI/Getty Images. As a longtime member of a Puritan group that separated from the Church of England in 1606, William Bradford...

Howland&rsquo;s story suggests the seminal power of the handful of Pilgrims who landed in Plymouth, near Cape Cod, in the late fall of 1620.  <b>Governor</b> William Bradford, the leader of the Pilgrims, organized a feast for this momentous event. This was recorded to have taken place in the autumn of 1621 in Plymouth. During this day, it was recorded that the celebration was held with the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag.  The first Thanksgiving was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first Thanksgiving.
