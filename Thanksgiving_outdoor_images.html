What This <b>Responsive</b> <b>Reading</b> is a declaration of thanksgiving to God who loves and provides for his people. Themes : Thanksgiving, Grateful, Thankful, Promises, God&#39;s Love, Worship, Provision Who Reader 1 Reader 2  The following is a <b>responsive</b> <b>reading</b> for a Thanksgiving service that starts out being thankful for the &ldquo;big picture items&rdquo; but progresses down to some close and personal items for which we also need to be thankful to God. I wrote it for use at our local church, but you could easily modify it to fit your own needs.  This Thanksgiving, as you gather around the dinner table with your friends and family, consider <b>reading</b> aloud some biblical reflections on the topic of thanksgiving.
