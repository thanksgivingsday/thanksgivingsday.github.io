        <p>Turkey Was it at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? Possibly! While turkeys are not mentioned specifically in records dating back to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, Edward Winslow, the author of one of the only accounts of the historic feast, mentioned that the governor sent four men to hunt fowl, and &ldquo;they four in one day killed as much fowl, as with a little help beside, served the company almost a week.&rdquo;  So which foods were actually eaten during the first Thanksgiving? According to Smithsonian Magazine, there are two surviving documents which state that deer, <b>wildfowl</b>, and corn (in the form of cornbread and porridge) were eaten.

So, if you are eating the common Thanksgiving <b>side dish</b> of marshmallow-laden candied yams this Thanksgiving, you are likely eating a &ldquo;soft sweet potato.&rdquo; By the time the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Thanksgiving of 1863 came about, sweet potatoes had made their way across the country, becoming especially popular in the southern United States due to the warm ...  Every single one of the traditional dishes for Thanksgiving has an <b>origin</b> <b>story</b>. Here&rsquo;s how each dish became a classic, plus some modern recipes to try.  Originally an English tradition, days of <b>thanksgiving </b>typically were marked by religious services to give thanks to God, or to celebrate a bountiful harvest.
