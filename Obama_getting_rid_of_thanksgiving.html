        <h2><strong>Obama getting rid of thanksgiving Absorbance of thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>But among the broader <b>American</b> <b>Jewish</b> community, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is widely celebrated and even embraced as an opportunity to lean into Americanness. In the 19th century, it was not uncommon for synagogues to hold services on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, as was the custom for a time among <b>American</b> churches.  Jewish tradition prescribes a blessing to be recited upon going to the restroom. Known <b>as</b> Asher Yatzar (&ldquo;who formed&rdquo;), it is a blessing of thanksgiving for the workings of the human body, without which it would be impossible to live and stand before God.  From the words we say upon arising (&quot;Modeh ani l&#39;fanecha,&quot; &quot; I give <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> [for <b>compassionately</b> restoring my soul]&quot;) to the daily multitude of blessings and prayers in our worship services, our tradition teaches us that showing gratitude is part of our way of life.  This <b>Thanksgiving</b>, as families and friends gather to reflect on their blessings, we have an opportunity to infuse the holiday with <b>Jewish</b> values and traditions that inspire unity and understanding. Incorporating the spirit of the Shehecheyanu into <b>Thanksgiving</b> is one way to do this&mdash;by embracing gratitude for the present moment and the people ...  Isn&rsquo;t the <b>Jewish</b> day jam-packed with &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;s? The first words we utter when waking in the morning express our thanks to G‑d for returning our souls to our bodies. Thrice daily during the course of <b>prayer</b>, we thank G‑d for everything imaginable. Before and after eating, we thank G‑d for the food.  Judah, the biblical figure whose name gives rise to the word Judaism, is another etymological relation, suggesting that gratitude is central to living a <b>Jewish</b> life. OneTable shabbat dinners ...  Etymologically, this is actually implied by <b>the </b>word modeh. Usually translated as &ldquo;thanks,&rdquo; <b>the </b>word is related to <b>the </b>Hebrew word <b>for </b>confession: viddui.To give thanks is really to admit ...  Thanksgiving, <b>like</b> <b>Sukkot</b>, invites us to pause, appreciate our blessings, open our homes to others, and find gratitude for what we have. Thanksgiving is one of America&rsquo;s most cherished holidays, a day for families and friends to come together, share a meal and reflect on the year&rsquo;s blessings.  Though all <b>prayers</b> may be discontinued, the <b>prayer</b> for <b>thanksgiving</b> will never cease. (Vayikra Rabbah) The sacrifice or offering of well-being known as sh&#39;lamim, <b>meaning</b> &quot;wholeness&quot; and/or &quot;peace,&quot; is first mentioned in Leviticus 3:1, in the first parashah of the Book of Leviticus. </p>        <p>Is w algreen open on thanksgiving.
