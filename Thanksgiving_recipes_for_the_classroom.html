        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving recipes for the classroom Family style thanksgiving dinner las vegas</strong></h2>
        <p>Picture a Thanksgiving feast where the main course comprises 90 to 140 pounds of meat&mdash;welcome to the world of African <b>lions</b>. When a pride successfully hunts, the male lion can devour a quarter of his body weight, while the agile females, often the primary hunters, can consume up to 55 pounds.  Turkeys are theropods, just like the meat-eating dinosaurs you so love to visit at the Museum. Paleontologists have known for years that modern birds are the direct descendants of feathered dinosaurs. These denizens of our <b>dinner</b> <b>tables</b> may not look as imposing as a T. rex, but anatomically&ndash;and most likely behaviorally&ndash;they are very much alike.  With these animal-based recipes for Thanksgiving, you can make a variation of the festive foods you know and love &ndash; dinner <b>rolls</b>, <b>stuffing</b>, pumpkin pie, <b>cranberry</b> sauce, an apple crisp &ndash; using whole, nutrient-dense foods without sacrificing taste or pleasure.

Whether you&rsquo;re a lion napping after a hearty kill or a hummingbird buzzing between flowers, the world of <b>animal</b> <b>dining</b> is as fascinating as our own holiday traditions.  A NOTE: This <b>Thanksgiving</b>, I am thankful for the volunteers and staff who work tirelessly to take care of, advocate for and protect the homeless <b>animals</b> in our community. You are making an ...  With so many vegan options readily available at your local market, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to serve an <b>animal</b>-<b>friendly</b> <b>meal</b> without compromising the traditional flavors and dishes that make Thanksgiving feel so familiar.
