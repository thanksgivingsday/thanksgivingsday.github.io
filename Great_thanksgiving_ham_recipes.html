        <p>From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  Although what was grown in those gardens isn&rsquo;t mentioned by name in historical documents, later sources <b>suggest</b> <b>turnips</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>onions</b> and <b>garlic</b> might have been available to cook with and eat for the first Thanksgiving meal.

Cranberries <b>were</b> eaten by Native Americans and used as a potent red dye, but sweetened cranberry relish was almost certainly <b>not</b> on the <b>first Thanksgiving</b> table. The pilgrims had long...  When the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag shared the first Thanksgiving in <b>1621</b>, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>turkey</b> were missing from the table.  But if one were to create a historically accurate feast, consisting of only those foods that historians are certain were served at the so-called &ldquo;first Thanksgiving,&rdquo; there would be <b>slimmer</b>... </p>        <p>Black friday harrisonburg va thanksgiving hours.
