        <p>If <b>you</b> celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> this year, ask yourself just what <b>you</b>&rsquo;re celebrating. Whether <b>you</b> choose to rejoice or mourn on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, initiate discussions about the holiday&rsquo;s origins by focusing on what the day meant for the Wampanoag and what it continues to signify for Indigenous peoples today.  For a respectful <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, she suggests that non-<b>Native</b> people do an Indigenous land acknowledgement, guides to which can be found online at places like the nonprofit <b>Native</b> Governance Center and the Smithsonian Center&rsquo;s National Museum of the <b>American</b> Indian.  While some <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> have chosen to reject the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday entirely, many embrace the positive messages of the day and choose to put aside thoughts about its complex history. This is because the idea of giving thanks is central to <b>Native</b> heritage and culture.  As you celebrate your own <b>Thanksgiving</b>, take a moment to reflect on the deeper meaning behind the holiday. Learn about the rich history and traditions of Indigenous people. Support Indigenous artists and businesses.  Here are a few recommendations to get you started: 1. <b>TASTE</b>. Try out a new Indigenous recipe to add to your table. Support local, Indigenous business and try Native foods from Thirteen Moons Kitchen! 2. LISTEN. Listen to Lyla June sing about our collective future when All Nations Rise.  Stories told about the first Thanksgiving often perpetuate harmful stereotypes and racism. It is important to set the record straight, acknowledge <b>Native</b> Peoples, debunk myths, and show Native Americans as contemporary people with dynamic thriving cultures.  Here is how most <b>American</b> Indians/Alaska Natives celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>: (1) From a feel good history to a feel bad history; (2) Instead of one day of the year to every day of the year; (3) From being religiously ordained to a day of mourning; (4) Instead of shopping till <b>you</b> drop buying only what <b>you</b> need and (4) From being ethnocentric to ...  How do <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> make peace with a national holiday that romanticizes the 1621 encounter between their ancestors and English settlers, and erases the deadly conflicts that followed?...  In the spirit of unity, we can instead focus <b>Thanksgiving</b> on common values: generosity, gratitude, and community. 1. Learn About Whose Lands You Are On. <b>Native</b> Lands App is an interactive map about your area&#39;s Indigenous Peoples and <b>languages</b>. 2.
