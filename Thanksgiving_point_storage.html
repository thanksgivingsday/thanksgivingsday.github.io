        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving point storage Chinese float at macys thanksgiving parade youtube</strong></h2>
        <p>So what <b>foods</b> <b>were</b> served <b>at</b> the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Courses and sides that <b>were</b> definitely not on the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> table To some extent, the exercise of reimagining the spread of <b>food</b> at the 1621 celebration becomes a process of elimination.  Have you ever wondered what the Pilgrims <b>ate</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? We dig into how similar the menu was to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original Thanksgiving harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as <b>corn</b> <b>bread</b> and <b>porridge</b>.  What Was on the Menu at the First Thanksgiving? Traditional Thanksgiving dinner includes <b>turkey</b>, stuffing and mashed potatoes but the First Thanksgiving likely included wildfowl, corn, porridge...  The first Thanksgiving in 1621 was a 3-day harvest celebration hosted by the Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans in Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts. Historical records indicate that the menu likely <b>included</b> <b>corn</b>, <b>berries</b>, <b>waterfowl</b>, <b>deer</b>, <b>seafood</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> among other local ingredients.  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  From seafood to carrots, historians report that what was <b>eaten</b> at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  There were no forks, but there was plenty of seafood and sides. 1. <b>Venison</b>. Edward Winslow&#39;s December 1621 letter that mentions the first Thanksgiving gathering doesn&#39;t offer up a ton of specifics about what was served that day, but one thing he made certain was that the Native Americans brought five deer to the meal. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving recipes make ahead mashed potatoes.
