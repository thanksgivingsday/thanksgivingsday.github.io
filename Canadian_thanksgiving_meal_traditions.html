        <p>Americans <b>waste</b> nearly three times more food on <b>Thanksgiving</b> than on a typical day. Here&#39;s how to limit&mdash;and deal with&mdash;the leftovers.  Each year at <b>Thanksgiving</b>, tables are heavy with slices of turkey, mounds of mashed potatoes and platefuls of pie. But after the feast is done, piles of food scraps and uneaten leftovers find...  WASHINGTON (November 25, 2020) &mdash; As America celebrates <b>Thanksgiving</b> this week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler reminds families and communities to consider the environment when planning their annual dinner and be mindful about wasting food.  Food waste is all the food that is fit for consumption but is consciously discarded. Every year, American families waste about <b>1,160</b> <b>pounds</b> of food, especially around Thanksgiving where an estimated 305 million pounds of food are wasted from Thanksgiving dinner alone.  Don&#39;t <b>waste</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> leftovers. Minimizing food <b>waste</b> is one of the most important things people can do -- especially at family gatherings where excess food could go to <b>waste</b>, said Wright ...  We track state policies in food <b>waste</b>, and in 2023, 91 unique state bills on food <b>waste</b> were introduced, and 23 were enacted. Most exciting to me is a new law in California to standardize date labels.  (This is about 1.3 percent more <b>waste</b> than in 2023 due to population growth.) All of this discarded food could provide five meals to each of the 47.4 million people experiencing food insecurity in the U.S. When food goes to <b>waste</b>, all of the resources that went into producing it go to <b>waste</b> as well, including water, energy, labor, and land.  Before and after your <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal, consider these tips to reduce food <b>waste</b>. Each year, the average American family of four loses $1,500 to uneaten food &mdash; that&rsquo;s about 1,160 pounds of food. With <b>Thanksgiving</b> around the corner, it is timely to think about how we as individuals can keep our household food <b>waste</b> in check.  About 45 million turkeys are slaughtered each year for Americans to feast on, according to the National Turkey Federation. The fall holiday also prompts epic <b>waste</b>.
