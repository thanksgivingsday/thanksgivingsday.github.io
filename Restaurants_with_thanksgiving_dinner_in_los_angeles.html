        <h2><strong>Restaurants with thanksgiving dinner in los angeles The macys thanksgiving day parade 2024</strong></h2>
        <p>How did the <b>turkey</b> become a popular <b>Thanksgiving</b> centerpiece? Why do we eat <b>turkey</b> at Thanksgiving? Did the Pilgrims eat turkey? What about pumpkin pie? See how foods differed from today&mdash;and some historically inspired recipes, too!  Most Americans who celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash;about 9 in 10, according to a 2021 poll &mdash;eat <b>turkey</b> with their holiday meal, perhaps alongside other favorite dishes such as mashed potatoes, green...  &quot;Why do we eat turkey on Thanksgiving?&quot; is a question many of us ask amid the fixings <b>and</b> trimmings. Turkey wasn&rsquo;t always at the heart of the holiday table. We tapped an expert to help explain how turkey became inextricably associated with Thanksgiving, and here&#39;s what we found out.  Turkey is a Thanksgiving mainstay for sure; in fact so much so that some people call Thanksgiving &quot;turkey day.&quot; But do you know how and why turkey came to be so closely associated with the holiday? The reason we gobble up turkey on Thanksgiving is far from <b>simple</b>.  Discover <b>why</b> we eat <b>turkey</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, how the Thanksgiving meal has evolved and the turkey trends you&#39;ll want to try.  The big bird reigns as culinary king, so engrained in time-honored Thanksgiving customs that it&#39;s hard to imagine the holiday without its presence. This is largely <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b>, <b>but</b> also artistic endeavors by novelists to commemorate turkey&#39;s place on holiday <b>tables</b>.  Ashley Young, a historian from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, argued in a recent interview that one of the core reasons why turkey became so embedded within the cultural consciousness was <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b>, where the bird was plentiful and popular.  Have you ever wondered <b>why</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> revolves around <b>turkey</b> and not ham, chicken, venison, beef or corn? Almost 9 in 10 Americans eat <b>turkey</b> during this festive meal, whether it&rsquo;s roasted, deep-fried, grilled or cooked in any other way for the occasion.  Historians do know that <b>important</b> ingredients of today&rsquo;s traditional dishes were not available during that first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. That includes potatoes and green beans. The likely absence of wheat flour and the scarcity of sugar in New England at the time ruled out pumpkin pie and cranberry sauce. </p>        <p>Turkey replacement for thanksgiving.
