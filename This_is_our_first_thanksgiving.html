        <h2><strong>This is our first thanksgiving Trump calls for unity thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>With Thanksgiving next week, our common theme for this week&rsquo;s edition of Monday Morning Blooms was an arrangement or centerpiece for &lsquo;turkey day&rsquo;! A <b>cornucopia</b>, also known as a horn of plenty, symbolizes abundance and a bountiful harvest, associated with Thanksgiving. I filled my DIY <b>Cornucopia</b> with an assortment of flowers, <b>fruit</b> and veggies  This recipe for <b>Fruit</b> Cornucopias is an easy Thanksgiving treat that is not only healthy, but enjoyable for kids of all ages.  The <b>cornucopia</b> is typically a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket filled with various seasonal fruits and vegetables. Though most Americans associate the <b>cornucopia</b> with the Thanksgiving holiday, it was around long before Columbus sailed to America.  I used to believe that pecan and pumpkin pies were the only desserts you could serve for a Thanksgiving feast. But, throughout my years eating and hosting Thanksgiving dinners, I&#39;ve changed my mind. These <b>fresh</b>-<b>fruit</b> cornucopias make a healthy yet festive addition to any Thanksgiving dessert table.  Find the steps and supplies to create a <b>cornucopia</b>, or horn of plenty, for your Thanksgiving <b>table</b>. This centerpiece is easier to create than you might think and a festive way to celebrate harvest season.  Here&#39;s the history and meaning of the Thanksgiving <b>cornucopia</b>! Learn why the horn of plenty is a symbol of Thanksgiving, what purpose it serves, how to style one for a dinner centerpiece  While we can all agree that food and family are the most important elements of Thanksgiving, <b>the</b> cornucopia is a symbol that has come to represent the holiday while also giving the table a finished and festive look when used as DIY Thanksgiving centerpieces.  The <b>cornucopia</b> is a ubiquitous symbol of abundance, especially around Thanksgiving, starring in centerpieces on bountiful tables across the land. But where did the &ldquo;horn of plenty&rdquo; originate? A Thanksgiving cornucopia has a much longer, more elaborate history than you may imagine.  Style a centerpiece with yellow sunflowers, <b>fruit</b> and some fall blooms. The <b>cornucopia</b> is filled with apples, pears, pumpkins, bright blooms and leaves, some greenery, and it&#39;s a lovely fall decoration. </p>        <p>I hope you and your family have a great thanksgiving.
