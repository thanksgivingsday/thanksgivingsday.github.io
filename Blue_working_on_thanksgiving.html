        <h2><strong>Blue working on thanksgiving We gather together this day of thanksgiving lyrics</strong></h2>
        <p>It&rsquo;s important to know that for many <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b>, Thanksgiving <b>is</b> a day of mourning and protest since it commemorates the arrival of settlers in North America and the centuries of oppression and genocide that followed.  This Thanksgiving, we&rsquo;ve asked seven Native <b>American</b> chefs from different cultural and culinary backgrounds, working in different places around the country, to share holiday-worthy recipes with...  Although <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> people have always given thanks for the world around them, the Thanksgiving holiday celebrated today is more a combination of Puritan religious practices and the European festival called Harvest Home, which then grew to encompass <b>Native</b> foods.  In today&rsquo;s world, <b>Indigenous</b> Thanksgiving is celebrated in diverse ways across North America. Some communities may hold traditional ceremonies, dances, and feasts, while others may incorporate contemporary expressions of gratitude and cultural celebration into their Thanksgiving events.  In this video from the National Museum of the <b>American</b> Indian, Paul Chaat Smith (Comanche) co-curator of the exhibit Americans, looks at why the Thanksgiving story is so important to the United States&rsquo; image of itself as a nation. Watch it to gain a better understanding of Indigenous Peoples and Thanksgiving.  In this poster, we take a look at just a few <b>Native</b> communities understanding both <b>American</b> Indians and the deeper meaning of the Thanksgiving holiday. The themes are: &bull; Environment: traditional knowledge about and understandings of the natural world. &bull; Community: the role that group identity plays in <b>Native</b> cultures.  Indigenous scholars and activists say that the Thanksgiving story ignores a longer past and future for <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b>. Here is the whole story. Paula Peters remembers learning about the...  <b>Giving</b> <b>thanks</b> is a longstanding, central tradition among Indigenous peoples that is still practiced today. Native traditions are distinct, complex, and specific to each individual nation. Read and discuss the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address with your students.  The <b>Thanksgiving </b>story deeply rooted in America&rsquo;s school curriculum frames the Pilgrims as the main characters and reduces the Wampanoag Indians to supporting roles. It also erases a monumentally sad history. The true history of <b>Thanksgiving </b>begins with the Indians. </p>        <p>Football game thanksgiving weekend. Thanksgiving displays for church.
