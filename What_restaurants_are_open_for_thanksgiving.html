        <p>Happy Thanksgiving whether you are in Norway or anywhere else in the world. takk -thank you. takknemlig -thankful. Keep learning Norwegian with us! Build vocabulary, practice pronunciation, and more with Transparent <b>Language</b> Online. Available anytime, anywhere, on any device.  Prayers of <b>thanks</b> and special thanksgiving ceremonies are common among almost all religions after harvests and at other times. The Thanksgiving holiday&#39;s history in North America is rooted in <b>English</b> traditions dating from the Protestant Reformation.  It&rsquo;s almost time for Thanksgiving, one of my personal favorite holidays. We&rsquo;re all familiar with the classic story of Native Americans dining with Pilgrims. But, our modern day Thanksgiving <b>has</b> deeper Pagan roots than many may be aware of.  <b>Norse</b> Holidays and Festivals. The ancient <b>Germanic</b>/<b>Norse</b> year was divided into two seasons: Summer and Winter. Summer began at the festival of Eostre, close to the Spring Equinox, and Winter began at the festival of Winternights, close to the Autumn Equinox.  It is a neopagan festival of <b>thanksgiving </b>for the fruits of the earth and a recognition of the need to share them to secure the blessings of the Goddess and the Gods during the coming winter months. The name Mabon was coined by Aidan Kelly around 1970 as a reference to Mabon ap Modron, a character from Welsh mythology. [37]  <b>Frey</b> Feast or Freysblot (August 1st): thanksgiving for the fruits of the first harvest of the year. A loaf of bread is baked as an offering to the god Frey.  Kaare Askildt imagines an alternate history of why the Canadian <b>Thanksgiving </b>is earlier than the neighbors&#39; to the south, with a touch of Viking humor.  They celebrate several <b>Norse</b> Pagan holidays, the most important of which is Yule. <b>Norse</b> Pagan holidays were a big part of Viking traditions. When Christianity first reached Viking land in the mid 9th century, the Nordic peoples fought hard to retain their traditions.  Norwegians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>celebrate</b> Thanksgiving, and there has never been any interest in adapting this holiday here in Norway. However, many Norwegian-descended Americans celebrate Thanksgiving in the United States. </p>        <p>Happy belatee thanksgiving. Best thanksgiving dinner san jose. At&t store thanksgiving hours.
