        <p>As we enter this holiday season, this resource is intended to support educators and families as we address the true story of <b>Thanksgiving</b>. This guide provides resources that range from <b>lesson </b>plans to narratives that uplift the perspectives and contributions of the Native American community.  By taking a decolonizing approach to teaching about <b>Thanksgiving</b>, teachers and families reject the myths of <b>Thanksgiving </b>and harmful stereotypes about Native peoples.  Here are some resources to help educators and families approach <b>Thanksgiving </b>from an inclusive and socially responsive lens. These will help people who are wanting to teach about Native peoples and <b>Thanksgiving </b>itself in a more accurate way that is still developmentally appropriate.  We rounded up <b>lesson</b> plans, books, and videos to help you teach Thanksgiving in a socially responsible way, inclusive of Native perspectives.  We have sifted through the great wealth of online Thanksgiving curriculum resources to find the most thought-provoking, culturally sensitive <b>lesson</b> plans to use in your class room.

With <b>Thanksgiving </b>fast approaching, educators are grappling with how to teach their students about the first <b>Thanksgiving </b>in ways that honor the spirit of the holiday and are historically accurate and responsible.  How can educators, school leaders, families, and others address the <b>Thanksgiving </b>holiday while remaining culturally sensitive and true to history? How do we shift the conversation away from pilgrims and turkeys and towards honoring Indigenous peoples + a practice of gratitude? </p>        <p>What can you prepare the day before thanksgiving.
