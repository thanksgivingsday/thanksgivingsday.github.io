        <p>The holiday moved around to a number of different dates for more than a century, until <b>1957</b>, when the Canadian Parliament declared &ldquo;A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed &mdash; to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October.&rdquo;  The first Thanksgiving celebration in Canada took place <b>in</b> <b>1578</b> when the English explorer Martin Frobisher and his crew had a special feast to thank God for granting them safe passage through Northern Canada.  The first large, national Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>in</b> <b>1859</b> in what was then called the province of Canada. The province of Canada was developed when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united by Britain in 1841.  <b>In</b> <b>1879</b>, Thanksgiving was officially declared a national holiday to be held on <b>November</b> <b>6th</b>. Thanksgiving in Canada coincides with the completion of harvest in much of the country.  In Canada, Parliament established a national Thanksgiving Day <b>in</b> <b>1879</b>. Thanksgiving Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year.  Thanksgiving has been officially celebrated as an annual holiday in Canada <b>since</b> <b>November</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1879</b>. [5] . While the date varied by year and was not fixed, it was commonly the second Monday in October. [5]  Unlike American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s <b>national</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> date took decades to <b>become</b> standardized and annual. In 1957, <b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s parliament set the date as the second Monday in...  The first Thanksgiving after Confederation was observed <b>on</b> 5 April <b>1872</b>, a national civic holiday rather than a religious one. Thanksgiving was first observed as an annual event in Canada on 6 November 1879.  For many years before it was declared a national holiday <b>in</b> <b>1879</b>, Thanksgiving was celebrated in either late October or early November. From 1879 onward, Thanksgiving Day has been observed every year, the date initially being a Thursday in November. [ 28 ] </p>        <p>Red coach inn thanksgiving menu. Thanksgiving hazards for pets.
