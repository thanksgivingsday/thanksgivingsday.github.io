        <h2><strong>Maggiano little italy thanksgiving menu Thanksgiving feast foods</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving </b>was <b>the </b>most important holiday on <b>the </b>New England calendar, particularly since most people dismissed Christmas as a day of almost pagan excess. <b>Thanksgiving </b>occurred between late November and mid-December, after <b>the </b>harvest was <b>in</b>, but before annual butchering of animals.  Moving to the 18th century, the story of the political controversy surrounding our first Thanksgiving as a nation speaks volumes about our civil and religious freedoms. The controversy began on September <b>25</b>, <b>1789</b>, in New York City, then the seat of our federal government.  Within a hundred years, Thanksgiving became a New England custom, but its transformation into a national holiday is due to a long campaign by a <b>nineteenth</b>-<b>century</b> <b>writer</b>, <b>Sarah</b> <b>Josepha</b> <b>Hale</b>. Hale described a perfect Thanksgiving dinner in her novel Northwood (1827), with turkey in pride of place.  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th <b>century</b>. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  At this site near <b>the </b>James River <b>in </b>December of 1619, a group of British settlers led by Captain John Woodlief knelt <b>in </b>prayer and pledged &quot;<b>Thanksgiving</b>&quot; to God for their healthy arrival after a long voyage across <b>the </b>Atlantic.  For more than two centuries, days of <b>thanksgiving </b>were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, <b>in the </b>midst of <b>the </b>Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed...  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days of feasting and prayer to become <b>the </b>football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  Even <b>in the 18th</b> <b>century</b>, the concept of Thanksgiving was not new to the citizens of the new United States. Colonists often established thank days to mark certain occasions. These one-time events could occur at any time of the year and, emphasizing prayer and spiritual reflection, were usually more solemn than the Thanksgiving we observe today.  The celebration of Thanksgiving dates back to the Mayflower days in colonial Massachusetts, and over the course of the <b>18th</b> <b>century</b>, it evolved into a holiday celebrated around the dinner table. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving crafts preschoolers.
