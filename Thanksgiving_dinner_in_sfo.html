        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner in sfo Night time prayer of thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>When the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag shared the first Thanksgiving in 1621, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>, and <b>turkey</b> were missing from the table.  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony in...  So <b>what foods</b> were served at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? According to <b>food</b> historians, two surviving documents reference the maiden meal but only in broad strokes. Though turkey was likely present, experts believe the focus was more on goose or duck, but that swan and pigeons may have fit the poultry bill (puns withstanding) as well.  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these dietary staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at ...  What Did the Pilgrims Eat on the First Thanksgiving? Many dishes served during modern Thanksgiving meals were not present at the first Thanksgiving. The colonists didn&rsquo;t have <b>potatoes</b>, nor did they have butter or flour necessary for making pies.  These two sources contain all we know firsthand about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>food</b>. The rest of the menu we can only piece together, based upon what was available, what both groups ate in times of celebration, and what the Native Americans would have (literally) brought to the table.  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first Thanksgiving? The answer might surprise you!  Have you ever wondered what the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>ate</b> at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>?
