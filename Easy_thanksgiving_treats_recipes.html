Americans model their holiday on a 1621 harvest feast shared between the Wampanoag people and the English colonists known as Pilgrims .  <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day, observed <b>in </b>2024 on Thursday, November 28, honors a 1621 feast between the Plymouth colonists from <b>England </b>and the Wampanoag people. &ldquo;The reason that we have so many myths...  At the end of King Philip&rsquo;s War (1675&ndash;1678), which was waged between Indigenous people and New <b>England</b> colonists and their Indigenous allies, an official <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebration was proclaimed by the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  Once the Plymouth Colony had successfully established itself, after struggling through their first year, Mourt&#39;s Relation was carried back to <b>England</b> and published by Robert Cushman (l. 1577-1625) who had negotiated the Mayflower voyage.

Americans model their holiday on a 1621 harvest feast shared between the Wampanoag people and the English colonists known as Pilgrims.  One of the earliest and most popular possible origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> took place amongst the Plymouth colonists and the Native American Wampanoag people. In September 1620, the Mayflower ship set off from Plymouth harbor <b>in England</b>, carrying a relatively small crew of 102 passengers made up of religious separatists. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving roast.
