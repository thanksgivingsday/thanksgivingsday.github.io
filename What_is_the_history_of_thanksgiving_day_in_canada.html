        <p>A <b>play</b> about the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Indians would be a great addition to your family&rsquo;s Thanksgiving traditions. Begin by studying the lives of the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Indians . Learn how they left their homelands to find religious freedom.  Narrator 1: In the fall, the food was done growing and it was harvest time. Narrator 2: The <b>Pilgrims</b> from England and the Wampanoag from Massachusetts shared a meal they called Thanksgiving. Squanto: <b>Pilgrims</b>, you will find out corn is good to eat. Samoset: You will also find out Turkeys are good to eat. Turkey: Gobble? Gobble? Gulp!  A short, interactive <b>play</b> about the <b>Pilgrims</b> will get all your students involved! Students will learn about the Mayflower, Plymouth, &amp; Squanto. This is the perfect way to introduce students to the story of the 1st Thanksgiving.  Pilgrim children most likely played versions of <b>leapfrog</b> and tag. Combine these traditions in an over-under relay race: Line up teams of at least 3 players. The first player hands an object &mdash; a toy, small pumpkin, etc. &mdash; backward over her head to the next player, who then passes it between his legs.  This 15-minute, one act children&#39;s <b>play</b> tells the Thanksgiving story of Squanto, a Patuxet Indian who helped the <b>Pilgrims</b> at Plymouth Colony to survive in their first difficult years. He is also known as Tisquantum.  Help kids celebrate the First Thanksgiving with this super cute, free printable thanksgiving skits! Simply print pdf file, assign roles of <b>Pilgrims</b>, Indians, and get our suggestions for simple Thanksgiving costumes for a fun Thanksgiving activity and history activity for kids in November.  Here you will find fun, educational and engaging <b>Thanksgiving </b>songs, poems and fingerplays for children. Our activities are widely used by teachers, moms, dads, child care providers etc. for learning and teaching while being fun for the kids!  They pretended to hunt, fish, plant food, pick berries, <b>play</b> drums and sing an authentic song taught to them by the Native Americans who visited our class. The <b>Pilgrims</b> started out in the area of the room called England .  The play begins with the journey of the <b>Pilgrims</b> to the New World in their cramped vessel: The Mayflower. When the <b>Pilgrims</b> arrive in America they establish the Plymouth Colony. By the spring, the survivors are shown by friendly local Wamponoag Indians how best to plant crops. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving brunch vaughan. Windham hill thanksgiving.
