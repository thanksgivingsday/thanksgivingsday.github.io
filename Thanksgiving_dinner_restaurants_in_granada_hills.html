        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving dinner restaurants in granada hills Does avenue open on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>All of the earth-based old world religions were considered <b>pagan</b>. As time passed the term took on a darker tone and was used to demonize and persecute those who refused to convert. The great civilizations of the past had their own versions of Thanksgiving. The Romans celebrated a holiday called Cerelia in early October.  Read about <b>Thanksgiving</b>&#39;s origins, the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and how to celebrate modern <b>Thanksgiving </b>as an American <b>pagan </b>(native or not).  <b>Mabon</b> ~ Pagan Thanksgiving. Mabon is often referred to as the &quot;Pagan Thanksgiving&quot; due to its striking similarities with the traditional Thanksgiving holiday. Both celebrations are rooted in gratitude, abundance, and the acknowledgment of the harvest season.  If you&#39;re a <b>Pagan</b> who&#39;d like to add a simple <b>blessing</b> into your mealtime routines, try one of these short prayers to kick off your feast.  Most witches and pagans do what everyone else does for <b>Thanksgiving</b>: spend time with family, enjoy the outdoors, and give thanks for all that they have. This might include a <b>Thanksgiving </b>dinner, hiking in the woods, performing gratitude rituals, or decorating their altars.  It&rsquo;s almost time for <b>Thanksgiving</b>, one of my personal favorite holidays. We&rsquo;re all familiar with the classic story of Native Americans dining with Pilgrims. But, our modern day <b>Thanksgiving </b>has deeper <b>Pagan </b>roots than many may be aware of.  It is a time to give thanks for the <b>blessings</b> of the earth, connect with our ancestors, and honor the deities of abundance and harvest. In this blog post, we will explore the many ways that we can set up a <b>Pagan</b> altar for Thanksgiving, incorporating ancestral worship, deity work, Native American traditions, and magick and witchcraft.  Many cultures have a Thanksgiving ritual to celebrate the harvest of the year. This is true for pagans and witches as much as it is for anyone else. What do we give thanks for? There are many ways to give thanks, and I encourage you to do so throughout the year. I try to thank the gods every day through <b>prayer</b> and offerings.  <b>Pagans</b> can have such a zest for life, so express your gratitude in an exuberant way: cover your walls or your dinner table with kraft paper or cut-up paper shopping bags, put out some colored... </p>        <p><strong>Thanksgiving dinner restaurants in granada hills</strong>.
