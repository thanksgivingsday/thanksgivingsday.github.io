The colonists decided to <b>celebrate</b> with a harvest feast which has since been defined as the <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The narrative of the event is usually given along the lines provided by the scholar George F. Willison in his 1945 book, Saints and Strangers: Being the Lives of the Pilgrim Fathers &amp; Their Families, with Their Friends and Foes, which ...  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the <b>first</b> recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.
