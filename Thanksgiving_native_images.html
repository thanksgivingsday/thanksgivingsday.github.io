        <p>Heavily influenced by American Thanksgiving, the celebration in Brazil occurs on the same day in <b>November</b> as American Thanksgiving and has many practices that are the same. However instead of a big parade, Brazil celebrates with church services followed by a carnival.  While <b>Thanksgiving</b> as it&rsquo;s celebrated in the United States is not observed officially in <b>Brazil</b>, the country has its own special occasions and regional festivals that revolve around food, family, and thankfulness. Here&rsquo;s a glimpse of how Brazilians <b>celebrate</b> gratitude and togetherness, along with some of the delicious foods they enjoy.  Thanksgiving is not a <b>widely</b> celebrated holiday in <b>Brazil</b>, but some people still observe it in various ways, including attending church services, having a festive dinner with family and friends, and expressing gratitude for blessings.

When talking about what countries <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>Brazil</b> is the only country on the list in South America. Brazilian <b>Thanksgiving</b>, known as Dia de A&ccedil;&atilde;o de Gra&ccedil;as in Portuguese, follows the American tradition of a harvest feast on the fourth Thursday in November.
