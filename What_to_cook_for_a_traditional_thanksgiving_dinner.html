        <h2><strong>What to cook for a traditional thanksgiving dinner Thanksgiving nfl betting lines</strong></h2>
        <p>Avoid stuffing your kitchen to the brim by turning to these Thanksgiving for two recipes, instead. This list of dishes includes small-scale mains like roasted hen and turkey tenderloins, classic side dishes like <b>dressing</b> and mashed potatoes and, of course, lots of dessert recipes.  Ree Drummond&#39;s top-rated <b>Thanksgiving dressing</b> recipe is made with cornbread, Italian bread, and French bread. It&#39;s moist in the middle and crisp on top. Search  This small batch recipe is perfect for an intimate <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner, Christmas, or as a side dish for <b>two</b> any night of the week. It&rsquo;s great for all holiday meals. For more on the history and origins of stuffing, or <b>dressing</b> as it&rsquo;s also known, read this article.  Stale cornbread crumbles and stale bread cubes are tossed with your favorite <b>Thanksgiving</b> spices (sage, parsley, thyme, marjoram, and rosemary), and then baked in a custard of milk and eggs studded with chopped onions and celery. It&rsquo;s like a savory bread pudding, in the best way possible.  Now, I&rsquo;ll go into some best tips for making small batch stuffing. This recipe is perfect for 2-4 people, with 4 servings (yay leftovers!). For a small gathering I don&rsquo;t want to make enough for 8-12 people. This recipe is great for a small group or solo <b>thanksgiving</b>!  Approximate cost/serving: It only costs $1.45 to make the whole dish. It serves <b>two</b> as a single side, or 4 with multiple sides like for <b>Thanksgiving</b>. So only 36 cents a serving. Vegetarian: You can make this vegetarian by subbing vegetable broth for the chicken broth. We&#39;d love to keep in touch.  However, the recipe I am sharing today is both a <b>dressing</b> and a stuffing. I am cooking it in a baking pan and then stuffing it inside turkey breast cutlets for what I think will be an easy <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner for <b>two</b> with all the trimmings.  Try these <b>Thanksgiving</b> for <b>two</b> recipes when you aren&#39;t serving a crowd! From traditional turkey and stuffing to indulgent dishes like chicken Alfredo and shrimp scampi, these dinners are sure to please.  This fairly classic stuffing recipe has been scaled down to feed <b>two</b> (generously). Filled with buttery saut&eacute;ed shallots and plenty of herbs, it&rsquo;s rich and soft in the center, and golden and... </p>        <p>The friends thanksgiving sandwich.
