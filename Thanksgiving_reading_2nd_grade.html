        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving reading 2nd grade Thanksgiving family skits</strong></h2>
        <p>From the earliest fall <b>feasts</b> to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  Festivals <b>of Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day <b>of Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest <b>feast</b> shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  The legend of the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday is said to have been based on a <b>feast</b> <b>of thanksgiving</b> in the early days of the American colonies almost 400 years ago. The tale as it is told in grade schools is a legend, a mythologized version that downplays some of the bleaker history of how <b>Thanksgiving</b> became an American national holiday.  The meal consisted of deer, corn, shellfish, and roasted meat, different from today&#39;s traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>feast</b>. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day in Plymouth happened two years later in 1623.  While the settlers at Plymouth and their allies from the Wampanoag tribe really <b>did</b> get together in 1621 for a table-groaning, three-day <b>feast</b> to celebrate the settlers&#39; first harvest, that&#39;s far ...  Here&rsquo;s a little background about the much-mythologized meal. 1. It wasn&rsquo;t actually a &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; In 1841, Boston publisher Alexander Young printed a book containing a letter by pilgrim ...  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the <b>feast</b> were ever written. The first account is William Bradford&#39;s journal&hellip; </p>        <p>Lowrider thanksgiving pictures. Atlanta track club thanksgiving day half marathon. Thanksgiving reading 2nd grade.
