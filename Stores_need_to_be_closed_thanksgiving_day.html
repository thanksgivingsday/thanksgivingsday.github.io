        <h2><strong>Stores need to be closed thanksgiving day Thanksgiving turkey family project</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Hanukkah</b> (Chanukah) is the Jewish eight-<b>day</b>, wintertime &ldquo;festival of lights,&rdquo; celebrated with a nightly menorah lighting, special prayers and fried foods. The Hebrew word Chanukah means &ldquo;dedication,&rdquo; and is thus named because it celebrates the rededication of the Holy Temple (as you&rsquo;ll read below).  Chanukah was declared a Jewish national holiday 2178 years ago. <b>Thanksgiving</b> was declared a national American holiday on the last Thursday of every November by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Before then, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was celebrated on different dates in different states, so we won&rsquo;t count those.  From lighting a menorah, to giving out gelt, to eating cheese&mdash;find out how these <b>Hanukkah</b> traditions began.  <b>Chanukah</b> (also spelled Hanukkah) is an 8-day Jewish festival marking the miraculous victory of the Maccabees, Jewish freedom fighters, over the Seleucidian Greek occupiers in the year 139 BCE.  Hanukkah &mdash; also spelled Chanukah or other transliterations from Hebrew &mdash; is Judaism&rsquo;s &ldquo;<b>festival</b> of <b>lights</b>.&rdquo; On eight consecutive nightfalls, Jews gather with family and friends to light one additional candle in the menorah &mdash; a multibranched candelabra.  While <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>day</b> of gratitude for the harvest, <b>Hanukkah</b> is a time to celebrate religious freedom, the rabbi added. According to history, <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> first took place with the Pilgrims who came to America in search of free religious exercise.  The next year, they instituted those days and made them holidays of praise and <b>thanksgiving</b>. Shabbat 21b. The story of the miracle of the oil that lasted for eight days is, perhaps, the most well known of <b>Hanukkah</b>&rsquo;s origin stories. It&rsquo;s what is usually found in children&rsquo;s books, told in Hebrew schools and recalled at <b>Hanukkah</b> parties.  An addition is made to the &quot;hoda&#39;ah&quot; (<b>thanksgiving</b>) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al HaNissim (&quot;On/about the Miracles&quot;). This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons. The same prayer is added to the grace after meals.  <b>Hanukkah</b>, or the Festival of Rededication, celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem after its defilement by the Syrian Greeks in 164 BCE. Although it is a late addition to the Jewish liturgical calendar , the eight-day festival of Hanukkah <b>has</b> become a beloved and joyous holiday. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving sale gander mountain.
