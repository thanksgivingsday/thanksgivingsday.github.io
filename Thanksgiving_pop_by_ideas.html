        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving pop by ideas Are california parking meters on on thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>In the modern consciousness, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is strongly associated with the near-mythological story of the Pilgrims at Plymouth (the English colonists) and their Wampanoag Indian neighbors, who shared a meal to celebrate the harvest in 1621. However, days of <b>thanksgiving</b> on a variety of occasions have been celebrated throughout American <b>history</b>.  The <b>event</b> was a harvest festival with a mix of religious, pagan and practical traditions dating back centuries. ... For this piece on the real <b>history</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, we spoke with Amy Jakober ...  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> day <b>event</b> was created by Macy&rsquo;s Department store, whose flagship store in Herald Square marks the end of the parade. As technology and the economy have advanced over the years, the parade has grown to feature large balloons of popular cultural characters and has extensive television coverage throughout the United States and ...  From the earliest fall feasts to the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> football game to the Macy&#39;s Day parade, here&#39;s the full background on how the U.S. holiday evolved to the tradition it is today.  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  <b>Thanksgiving</b>: Fact or Fiction &ldquo;The reason that we have so many myths associated with <b>Thanksgiving</b> is that it is an invented tradition. It doesn&rsquo;t originate in any one <b>event</b>.  Festivals of <b>Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  Although the 1621 <b>event</b> is cited as the inspiration for the <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday in the modern era, <b>thanksgiving</b> celebrations, up through and including Kennedy&#39;s proclamation, have been encouraged and observed in the United States for reasons having little to do with the accounts in the primary documents.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving cards inside.
