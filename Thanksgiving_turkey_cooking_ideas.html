        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving turkey cooking ideas Queen mary chill thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Father</b> <b>Francis</b> <b>Weiser</b>, S.J., in the chapter on Thanksgiving in his Handbook of Christian Feasts and Customs, elaborates how the act of thanksgiving flows naturally within man: The religious...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a national holiday, not a Church holy day. Yet, little is known about the Catholic <b>roots</b> of this annually commemorated day of gratitude. Traditional tales hold that the English Puritans struggled to establish a successful colony in the New World.  In this blog, we will explore the Catholic perspective on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, its historical roots, its spiritual dimensions, and practical ways to celebrate the holiday meaningfully. Historical Context of Thanksgiving  By anchoring <b>Thanksgiving</b> in its historical and spiritual <b>roots</b>, we can transform it from a secular celebration into a sacred moment of reflection and unity. Let us follow the example of our Catholic forebears and the early settlers in giving thanks to God for His abundant blessings.  The Catholic origins of Thanksgiving don&rsquo;t stop there. <b>Squanto</b> , the beloved hero of Thanksgiving, was the Native American man who mediated between the Puritan Pilgrims and the Native Americans. Squanto had been enslaved by the English but he was freed by Spanish Franciscans.  Most American Catholics grew up with the familiar tale of the origins of Thanksgiving&mdash;that around <b>1621</b> the Puritan colonists of Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts, celebrated the first Thanksgiving along with Native Americans in the area.  In fact, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is really a Catholic feast day. Although that first <b>Thanksgiving</b> date is unclear, historians note that when the Catholic Spanish explorers landed in the New World, each celebrated a feast with local Native Americans giving thanks to this new land.  Thanksgiving&rsquo;s universal appeal is due in part to its deep Catholic roots. The origin story of Thanksgiving that we usually tell is that of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, the group of settlers that arrived in 1620 in what is now Massachusetts. Half of them died the first winter.  It was this event that is the basis of America&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> holiday. I thought that information was pretty cool. This day is not listed on the Church Calendar per se but in honor of its Catholic <b>roots</b>, we feast today on good food and choice wine in honor of the abundance of food and the religious freedom that we are still able to practice ... </p>        <p>Thanksgiving getaways in oregon.
