        <p>But the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> in 1621, shared between the <b>Pilgrims</b> of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;<b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.

Museums and historic sites in Plymouth and around the country are telling a more nuanced story about the...  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621. </p>        <p>Cute thanksgiving table decorating ideas.
