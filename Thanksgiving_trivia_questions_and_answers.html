        <p>From that time forward, <b>Thanksgiving </b>has been celebrated as a day to give thanks to God for His gracious and sufficient provision. President Abraham Lincoln officially set aside the last Thursday of November, in 1863, &ldquo;as a day of <b>thanksgiving </b>and praise to our beneficent Father.&rdquo;  In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the spiritual roots of <b>Thanksgiving</b>.

In 1816 New Hampshire and Massachusetts declared different days in November as days of Thanksgiving.  The Origin of Thanksgiving. Where did Thanksgiving begin? Americans today model the Thanksgiving holiday on a <b>1621</b> harvest feast shared between English colonists and the Wampanoag Indians. This shared feast is recognized as the first Thanksgiving celebration in the American colonies. Colonists in New England and Canada regularly held ...  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a relationship between God and man. Upon their arrival at New Plymouth, the Pilgrims composed The Mayflower Compact, which honored God. <b>Thanksgiving </b>begins with acknowledging God as faithful, earnestly giving Him thanks, in advance, for His abundant blessings. </p>        <p>Holidays to quebec city.
