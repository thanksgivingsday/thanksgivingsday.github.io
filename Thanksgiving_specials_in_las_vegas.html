        <p>When you&rsquo;re <b>leaving </b>your job, sending a farewell <b>letter is </b>an appropriate thing <b>to </b>do. This <b>is </b>the perfect way for you <b>to </b>say, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; <b>to </b>your colleagues for having worked with them. This <b>is </b>also the best way for you <b>to </b>share your contact information.
