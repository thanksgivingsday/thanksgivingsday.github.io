        <h2><strong>Target closed thanksgiving 2024 Driving aaa sunday after thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>It has been pointed out many times in the past, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to reflect on it once again, as we celebrate <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day: the Greek-derived word for <b>thanksgiving </b>is &quot;eucharist,&quot; the same...  We celebrate Thanksgiving every time Catholics <b>receive</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>in</b> the Eucharist. We even celebrate it every time we adore him for minutes if not hours through adoration. The Eucharist helps Catholics be thankful for Jesus as he laid down everything for us.  The connection between the Eucharist and thanksgiving is more than <b>linguistic</b>; there is a profound connection between the Eucharist established by Christ and the fulfillment of the Old Covenant in the New.  The word Eucharist means <b>thanksgiving</b>. When we celebrate the <b>Mass </b>we are participating in a <b>thanksgiving </b>celebration. We give thanks for all that had been given to us by God, particularly the gift that is Jesus. The <b>Mass </b>is a time when we share and celebrate our faith in Jesus  Several of the reasons we go to <b>Mass</b> may be the same reasons we look forward to gathering on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day: as a response of gratitude to God&rsquo;s love and generosity in our lives; to strengthen bonds with our family or community, and to provide a legacy to younger generations.  The Catechism states that the Eucharist &ldquo;is an act of <b>thanksgiving</b> to God&rdquo; (No. 1329). The entire Mass is a prayer of <b>thanksgiving</b>, which is stated explicitly in some prayers and implied throughout.  In the <b>Mass</b>, we enter into Jesus&rsquo; constant and ubiquitous <b>thanksgiving</b> to the Father. The <b>Mass</b> is our continuous <b>thanksgiving</b> from the rising of the sun to its setting. It is a prayer that...  It is gratifying to know that Catholics often come to Mass on Thanksgiving. They come because they have a sense that it is fitting to offer thanks to God. However, the business of offering thanks has a much more profound meaning than a simple &ldquo;<b>thank</b> you&rdquo;, or even a festive family meal.  In our prayer, study and reflection on the new translation of the prayers of the <b>Mass</b>, I encourage us all to give thanks for the gift of the Mass, for the privilege of participating right here... </p>        <p>Annapolis md restaurants open for thanksgiving.
