        <h2><strong>Things to do on thanksgiving day in pittsburgh Thanksgiving words that start with z</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1838, Lower <b>Canada</b> used <b>Thanksgiving</b> to <b>celebrate</b> the end of the Lower <b>Canada</b> Rebellion. [24] Following the rebellions, the two Canadas were merged into a united Province of <b>Canada</b>, which observed <b>Thanksgiving</b> six times from 1850 to 1865. [24] During this period, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a solemn, mid-week celebration. [26]  Historically, he says, <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> has generally been about celebrating the fall harvest and giving thanks for the food it provides before the cold season sets in. &ldquo;Winter comes a lot ...  The Pilgrims didn&rsquo;t arrive at Plymouth until 1621, but American <b>Thanksgiving</b> became a national holiday nearly a century before its <b>Canadian</b> counterpart did in 1879, according to the <b>Canadian</b> ...  Now, <b>Canadians</b> <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> for similar reasons to Americans: It&rsquo;s a time to gather family and friends for a festive meal. But this hasn&rsquo;t always been the gist of the holiday in <b>Canada</b>.  So if American <b>Thanksgiving</b> comes from a historical event, why <b>do</b> <b>Canadians</b> <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>? It may be surprising to hear that <b>Canadian</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is actually older than its southern counterpart&#39;s celebration. There are also some differences between how the holidays are celebrated across borders.  The Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest parade serves as <b>Canada</b>&#39;s only <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day parade and is broadcast nationwide. <b>Canadians</b> also enjoy football on <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day - the <b>Canadian</b> Football League holds a nationally televised doubleheader known as the &quot;<b>Thanksgiving</b> Day Classic&quot;. References. wikipedia:<b>Thanksgiving</b>; wikipedia:<b>Thanksgiving</b> (<b>Canada</b>)  <b>Canada</b> doesn&rsquo;t put on anything of this scale to <b>celebrate</b>, however, there are some harvest festivals and <b>Thanksgiving</b>-adjacent events to mark the season, a time when the leaves are changing and ...  <b>Canada</b> celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> decades before the Pilgrims, but the holiday in the U.S. and its northern neighbor have much in common. ... Though plenty of <b>Canadians</b> <b>celebrate</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, it isn ...  Other <b>Canadian Thanksgiving</b> celebrations were held in gratitude for being spared the bloodshed of the American Civil War and to <b>celebrate</b> the Prince of Wales recovering from serious illness in 1872. However, most <b>Canadians</b> today would tell you that <b>Canadian Thanksgiving</b> is simply a celebration of the harvest season and the community. </p>        <p><a href="./684.html">Nypd and thanksgiving day parade 2024 arrests</a>.
