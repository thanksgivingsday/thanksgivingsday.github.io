        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving restaurants near me How to cook the turkey for thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>The first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. In the Fall of 1621, the Pilgrims famously shared a harvest feast with the Pokanokets; the meal is now considered the basis for the <b>Thanksgiving </b>holiday.  In September 1620, a small <b>ship</b> called the Mayflower left Plymouth, England, carrying 102 passengers&mdash;an assortment of religious separatists seeking a new home where they could freely practice...  Four hundred years have passed since the epic voyage of the Mayflower, years which have enshrouded its story in myth and legend. The commonly held belief that the Mayflower carried intrepid religious refugees from persecution in England to freedom in the New World is only partially true.  Mayflower, in American colonial history, the <b>ship </b>that carried the Pilgrims from England to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where they established the first permanent New England colony in 1620.  View the original list of passengers (PDF, 2.6Mb) from the handwritten manuscript of Gov. William Bradford, written up about 1651 (file link is to the State Library of Massachusetts). Below is a complete list of all Mayflower passengers, along with a link to each for further information. John and Eleanor Billington, and sons John and Francis.  Mayflower was an English sailing <b>ship</b> that transported a group of English families, known today as the Pilgrims, from England to the New World in 1620.  For American culture, the story of the Pilgrims, including their &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  For those descended from those who survived, it is not <b>Thanksgiving </b>- it is a National Day of Mourning. The video below seeks to tell the story from the point of view of the Wampanoag tribe, descendants of those who watched the Mayflower arrive on their shores in 1620.  The <b>ship </b>&lsquo;Mayflower&rsquo; has played a very significant role in the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, because it was the historic <b>ship </b>that took the Pilgrims to America in 1620. The pilgrims were basically the fortune hunters, bound for the resourceful &lsquo;New World&rsquo;. </p>        <p>Restaurants open on christmas johnson city tn. Macys parade band schedule.
