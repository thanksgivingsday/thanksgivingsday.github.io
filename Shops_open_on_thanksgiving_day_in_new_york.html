        <p><b>Turkey</b> or no <b>turkey</b>, the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rsquo;s attendees almost certainly got their fill of meat. Winslow wrote that the Wampanoag arrived with an offering of five deer.  How did <b>turkey</b> become the centerpiece of this feast? It is often assumed that today&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu originated in an event commonly referred to as the &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&rdquo; There is indeed evidence of a meal shared between Pilgrim settlers at Plymouth colony (in what is now Massachusetts) and Wampanoag people in late 1621.  Turkey, a Thanksgiving staple so ubiquitous it has become all but synonymous with the holiday, may or may not have been on offer when the Pilgrims hosted the inaugural feast <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>.

Upon sitting down to a lackluster, turkey-less Thanksgiving feast at the turn of the 19th century, founding <b>father</b> <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> once remarked, &ldquo;No citizen of the U.S. shall refrain from...  The true history of Thanksgiving Day On the fourth Thursday of November, many Americans gather around the table with their families and fill their plates with <b>turkey</b>, cranberry sauce, and stuffing&mdash;but why?  A big, roast <b>turkey</b> is always the centerpiece of our <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. And, back in 1621, wild turkeys were also likely part of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>, but there were also other main dishes, like deer, duck, and goose. </p>        <p><a href="./407.html">Thanksgiving dinner 2024 austin</a>.
