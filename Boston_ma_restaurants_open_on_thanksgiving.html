        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is a holiday in the United States and Canada when people give thanks. In the United States, it is on the fourth Thursday of November. In Canada, it is on the second Monday of October. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln said the last Thursday of November would be a national Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> for the United States. [1]  The centerpiece of contemporary <b>Thanksgiving</b> in the United States is <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner (informally called turkey dinner), a large meal generally centered on a large roasted turkey. <b>Thanksgiving</b> could be considered the largest eating event in the United States as measured by retail sales of food and beverages [ 1 ] and by estimates of ...  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, November 28.

This week the U.S. celebrates the holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which has been an official national holiday since President Abraham Lincoln, after a campaign by magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, declared it as such in 1863.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  Thanksgiving is a <b>federal</b> <b>holiday</b> in the United States celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2] Outside the United States, it is sometimes called American Thanksgiving to distinguish it from the Canadian holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions.  In the United States, the Thanksgiving holiday is a <b>four</b>-day holiday over a weekend, starting on Thanksgiving Thursday and ending on Sunday. Families and friends usually eat a special meal together (usually with a turkey as the main dish).  Thanksgiving <b>is</b> a <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>God</b> <b>and</b> <b>man</b>.
