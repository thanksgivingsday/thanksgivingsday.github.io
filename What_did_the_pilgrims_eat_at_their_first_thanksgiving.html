Haudenosaunee (<b>Iroquois</b>) <b>Thanksgiving </b>Address. Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen &ldquo;Words Before All Else&rdquo; This prayer is a gift from <b>the </b>Haudenosaunee People (<b>The Iroquois </b>Nation), words of <b>thanksgiving </b>with ancient roots dating back to when <b>the Great </b>Law of Peace was brought to <b>the </b>people by <b>the </b>Peace Maker, <b>the Iroquois </b>prophet, statesman, and lawgiver.

The real observance of the first Thanksgivings by first peoples has been all but forgotten by American culture.  The Gyun Yuk as recited in English by Peter Brooks is an original Haudenosaunee (<b>Iroquois</b>) address that was given whenever people gathered for ceremonies or events. It is called &quot;Words Before All Else&quot; or &quot;<b>Thanksgiving</b> address&quot; or &quot;Greetings to the Natural World.&quot;  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> Address, or &ldquo;The Words that Come Before All Else,&rdquo; is delivered in Native Haudenosaunee languages at both the beginning &amp; the end of social gatherings, celebrations, and council meetings; and it is recited each morning at the beginning of the school day.  The <b>Thanksgiving</b> Address (the Ohen:ton Karihwatehkwen) is the central prayer and invocation for the Haudenosaunee (also known as the <b>Iroquois</b> Confederacy or Six Nations &mdash; Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora).
