        <p>Perhaps the best way to tell Thanksgiving and Christmas cacti apart is by <b>observing</b> <b>their</b> <b>growth</b> <b>habits</b>. Thanksgiving cactus has an upright growth habit (pictured above) with the stems pointing up. However, Christmas cactus has stems that hang downward, almost drooping.  A complete guide to the difference between the two underrated holiday houseplants: the Thanksgiving <b>cactus</b> and the <b>Christmas</b> <b>cactus</b>.  If your plant seems to be jumping the gun, it&#39;s likely not a <b>Christmas</b> <b>cactus</b> at all&mdash;it&#39;s a Thanksgiving <b>cactus</b>. These two plants are very similar in appearance, but there are a few key characteristics that can clear up their true identities.  The <b>Christmas</b> <b>cactus</b> typically blooms in shades of orange, pink, burgundy, and white, while the Thanksgiving <b>cactus</b> offers a variety of colors as well, including purple, white, red, or pink. It ...  One way to determine if a plant is a <b>Christmas</b> <b>cactus</b> versus a Thanksgiving <b>cactus</b> is to look at the shape of the plant. <b>Christmas</b> cacti have smooth, scalloped stems, while Thanksgiving cacti have pointed, pronounced stems.  Here&rsquo;s a startling revelation: you may have a Thanksgiving <b>cactus</b> instead of a Christmas cactus! Although they look very similar, they&rsquo;re two different plants. Unfortunately, the confusion between these holiday succulents is perpetuated by the fact that they&rsquo;re often mislabeled in garden centers.  Among the most popular indoor plants for the season are the holiday cacti: Thanksgiving cactus, Christmas cactus, and Easter <b>cactus</b>. Each variety offers a delightful way to mark the seasons with brightly colored blooms and unique leaf patterns.  How to Tell a Thanksgiving <b>Cactus</b> from a <b>Christmas</b> <b>Cactus</b>. It&rsquo;s actually not as hard as you think, says Di Lallo. Look at the flattened stems: Thanksgiving <b>cactus</b> (Schlumbergera truncata) stems have sharp pointy edges, while <b>Christmas</b> cacti (Schlumbergera bridgesii) have more rounded, scalloped edges.  The <b>Christmas</b> <b>cactus</b> has hanging flowers in shades of magenta and blooms, of course, near Christmas. The flowering range is late November through early February. The Thanksgiving cactus has flowers that face outwards, and the plant comes in various colors. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner fullerton ca. Happy thanksgiving retail.
