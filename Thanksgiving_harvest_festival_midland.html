        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving harvest festival midland Thanksgiving songs five little turkeys</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving</b> is not just about the feast but also a time for families to reunite, friends to catch up, and communities to bond. This sense of connection and reconnection is what makes <b>Thanksgiving</b> special. The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a gathering of hearts, a coming together in a time of need.  As was the custom in England, the <b>Pilgrims</b> celebrated their harvest with a festival. The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 Wampanoag tribesmen attended the &quot;First <b>Thanksgiving</b>.&quot; The major similarity between the first Jamestown settlers and the first Plymouth settlers was great human suffering.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is a national holiday in the United States, and <b>Thanksgiving</b> 2022 occurs on Thursday, November 24. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared an autumn harvest ...  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the <b>pilgrims</b>) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.

Myth: The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoags came together in November 1621 for a <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast. There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack with this one, and not just because it forms the basis of our country&rsquo;s ...  The <b>Pilgrims</b> in fact celebrated <b>thanksgiving</b> in relation to the end of the harvest, between the end of September and the beginning of November. On 3rd October 1863, President Lincoln set a date for <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day for the &ldquo;last Thursday of November&rdquo;, probably remembering the anchoring of the Mayflower on November 21st, 1620.  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.
