        <p>Bring 1 quart water, 3/4 cup salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, bay leaves and lemon zest to a boil in an extra-large pot (large enough to hold the <b>turkey</b> breast).  You can use canned broth or <b>make</b> your own. It&#39;s easy to <b>make</b> a quick broth from the <b>turkey</b> neck and giblets that were inside the <b>turkey</b> <b>before</b> it was roasted. Check out my post: Quick &amp; Easy <b>Turkey</b> Neck and Giblet Broth. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Step 10. Reheat the <b>turkey</b> without overcooking it.  Place the <b>turkey</b> in the refrigerator for 3-4 days until thawed. Remove the bag of giblets from the inside of the <b>turkey</b>. Empty the giblets into your roasting pan as they help <b>make</b> a good, rich broth.  DRY BRINE. In a small bowl, combine the salt, rosemary, and lemon zest. Set aside. <b>TURKEY</b>. Two to three days <b>before</b> baking the <b>turkey</b>, wash the <b>turkey</b> inside and out and drain it for at least 5 minutes until it&rsquo;s thoroughly drained.  Place the <b>turkey</b> in a shallow dish just large enough to hold it and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 or 2 days. The day <b>before</b> you plan to roast the <b>turkey</b>, remove the plastic wrap and leave the <b>turkey</b> in the fridge. The skin will dry out and turn a little translucent. Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F (165&deg;F).  The day <b>before</b> serving, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the thyme and rosemary on the bottom of a baking sheet. Put the <b>turkey</b> pieces on top, dot with the cubed butter, drizzle with the ...  Roast, uncovered, 30 minutes. In a 4-cup measuring cup, mix broth, herbs, lemon zest, lemon juice, and garlic; pour over <b>turkey</b>. Roast uncovered until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees, about 3 to 3 &frac12; hours.  This worked like a charm! I took an entire <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner on the road and followed the instructions for reheating when we got to our destination: poured a little chicken broth and some drippings from the day <b>before</b> over the sliced <b>turkey</b> and reheated for about 45 minutes. Just as juicy and moist as if it was just roasted.  You can still prep the <b>turkey</b> in advance if you don&rsquo;t want to miss out on carving it in front of your guests. Simply brine the <b>turkey</b> two to three days <b>before</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. The <b>night</b> <b>before</b> the big event, remove it from the brine and place it in a roasting pan&mdash;adding chopped onions, carrots and celery to the pan, if you like. </p>        <p>Volunteer thanksgiving green bay wi.
