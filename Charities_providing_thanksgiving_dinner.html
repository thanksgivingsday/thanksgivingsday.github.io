        <h2><strong>Charities providing thanksgiving dinner What is thanksgiving day for</strong></h2>
        <p>The <b>Gloria</b> When indicated this hymn is either sung or said: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will. We praise <b>you</b>, we bless <b>you</b>, we adore <b>you</b>, we glorify <b>you</b>, we give <b>you</b> thanks for your great glory, Lord God, heavenly King, O God, almighty Father. Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God,  A few unique liturgies are Palm Sunday, when <b>you</b> will not <b>sing</b> the <b>Gloria</b>, but on Holy Thursday, Evening <b>Mass</b> of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, <b>you</b>&rsquo;ll <b>sing</b> the <b>Gloria</b> since it is a Solemnity. Today, December 12, is the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe.  During Lent, in place of the Alleluia, the verse before the Gospel is sung, as indicated in the Lectionary. It is also permissible to <b>sing</b> another psalm or tract, as found in the Graduale.  The Gloria, a hymn of joy and praise, is recited or sung on all <b>Sundays</b> except during Advent and Lent (which are penitential seasons) and also on many important feasts that occur on weekdays.  As discussed in <b>the </b>September 2014 issue of Liturgy Update, both <b>the </b>Roman Missal and <b>the </b>Order of Celebrating Matrimony indicate that <b>the Gloria </b>is to be sung or said in ritual Masses for <b>the </b>celebration of marriage, including those that occur during Advent and Lent.  The Gloria is sung on solemnities and feasts &quot;and at particular celebrations of a more solemn character.&quot; (GIRM 53) So <b>you</b> could <b>sing</b> the <b>Gloria</b> at, say, a votive Mass of <b>Thanksgiving</b> when there is an occasion of rejoicing in the diocese. (Personally, I would get the bishop&#39;s OK if he wasn&#39;t going to be present.)  Although we&rsquo;re used to <b>singing</b> the <b>Gloria</b> at church, the ancient hymn wasn&rsquo;t always part of the liturgy. &ldquo;This hymn was not originally part of the <b>Mass</b> but was probably sung as the Te Deum is today, as a <b>thanksgiving</b> hymn for feasts and celebration,&rdquo; Monsignor Charles Pope wrote in his book, The <b>Mass</b> in Slow Motion. The <b>Gloria</b> <b>at Mass</b>  The <b>Gloria</b> is a hymn of praise; therefore, it is best to <b>sing</b> it whenever possible. Like the Alleluia <b>at Mass</b>, it is a part of <b>Mass</b> that almost demands that it be sung by its very nature. If the <b>Gloria</b> is not sung, it is never omitted on the days when it is required but is simply recited.  The Gloria. After we say, &ldquo;Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy&rdquo; we all break into the Gloria. We <b>sing</b> <b>glory</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b>. The Gloria goes from the Incarnation to the sacrifice of Christ. It&rsquo;s like salvation history in miniature form. As a congregation we&rsquo;re giving glory to God. We&rsquo;re praising him for all that he has done. </p>        <p>Tips on how to include your toddler in thanksgiving. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/802.html">Thanksgiving weekend activities hamilton</a>.
