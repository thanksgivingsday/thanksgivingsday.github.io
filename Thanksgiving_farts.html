        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving farts Yummy cranberry sauce recipe thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>You&#39;ve probably heard stories about the first Thanksgiving - you know, <b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans coming together for a grand feast. Join us as we review the facts - and do a bit of myth-busting.  Myth: The <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoags came together in November 1621 for a Thanksgiving feast. There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack with this one, and not just because it forms the basis of our country&rsquo;s ...  What is the Thanksgiving myth? The myth is that friendly Indians, unidentified by tribe, welcome the <b>Pilgrims</b> to America, teach them how to live in this new place, sit down to dinner with them...  As was the custom in England, the <b>Pilgrims</b> celebrated their harvest with a festival. The 50 remaining colonists and roughly 90 Wampanoag tribesmen attended the &quot;First Thanksgiving.&quot; The major similarity between the first Jamestown settlers and the first Plymouth settlers was great human suffering.  For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> 1621.  The first <b>Thanksgiving </b>was a harvest celebration held by the pilgrims of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  The <b>Pilgrims</b> were people who traveled from England to the Netherlands and then to New England by the beginning of the 17 th century. They are nowadays easily related to Thanksgiving Day because, after the first harvest season in New England, they gave thanks to God and to the natives who helped them survive, celebrating for three days.
