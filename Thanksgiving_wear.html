        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving wear Thanksgiving paper with lines</strong></h2>
        <p>As an American colony <b>from</b> <b>1898</b> <b>to</b> <b>1946</b>, the Philippines celebrated Thanks giving on the same day as the United States. President Manuel Quezon even declared it an official local holiday in 1935. Commemoration paused during the Japanese occupation, although locals still celebrated secretly.  During the American colonialization, Thanksgiving day was celebrated among Filipinos. According to Malacanan Palace archives, the U.S Governor General proclaimed thanksgiving day as a national holiday. In the <b>Philippines</b>, it was at Pasay city where the first thanksgiving was celebrated on November 24, 1899 for Company D with 30 U.S volunteers.  Scroll to the right then down a bit until you see a small article entitled &ldquo;Thanksgiving <b>in Philippines</b>&rdquo;. Note that the article was published in December 30, 1898 &mdash; just 20 days after the Treaty of Paris was signed and Spain ceded the <b>Philippines</b> (along with Cuba, Puerto Rico and Guam) to the United States for a measly sum of $20M.  In the <b>early</b> <b>20th</b> <b>century</b>, the Philippines embraced Thanksgiving Day as part of its cultural heritage during the American colonial period.  Below, I will examine the Philippines Thanksgiving proclamations beginning <b>in</b> <b>1935</b>, with an emphasis on the proclamations issued between 1935 and 1945 (inclusive). In so doing, I will excerpt interesting sections from the proclamations.  Hi Bruce &ndash; Whoever was the fist President to declare Thanksgiving as a holiday, we probably all know that the day of Thanksgiving, and the meal that goes along with it dates back to the <b>17th</b> <b>century</b> when the Pilgrims first landed in America.  <b>Thanksgiving </b>is a national holiday celebrated on various dates <b>in </b>October and November <b>in </b>the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially <b>in </b>countries like Brazil, Germany and the <b>Philippines</b>. It is also observed <b>in </b>the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  With the Filipinos and Americans sharing part of history and culture when the Philippines was colonized by the Americans <b>from</b> <b>1898</b> <b>to</b> <b>1946</b>, the practice of celebrating Thanksgiving Day was introduced.  Fun fact: Thanksgiving Day was previously celebrated in the <b>Philippines</b>. The idea of the <b>Philippines</b> commemorating a controversial feast between the Pilgrims and Native Americans in 1621 may... </p>        <p>Kohls thanksgiving 2024 hours.
