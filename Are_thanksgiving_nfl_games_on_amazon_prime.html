        <p><b>Meaning</b> of Thanksgiving. The first known use of the word &quot;thanksgiving&quot; in an English text is from William Tyndale&#39;s translation of the New Testament in 1526. He uses the word in 2 Corinthians 4:15 and 9:11, in Colossians 4:2 and in 1 Timothy 4:4. In his spelling it appears as &quot;thankesgevynge&quot;.

The foundation of your thanks is based upon the theological realities of what Christ has done in you, in recreating, sustaining and caring for you.  The act of <b>thanksgiving </b>is a way of recognizing the faithfulness of God in our lives &ndash; it is a way to consciously take time to humble ourselves before God and each other. And Scripture says those who humble themselves will one day be lifted up by God.  Thanksgiving is <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of <b>our</b> <b>prayers</b>.
