        <p>But the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in 1621</b>, shared between the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the ...  In fact, it took place <b>over</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> sometime between late September and mid-November in 1621, and was considered a harvest celebration.  What Food Was Served at the First <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in 1621</b>? ... there were only a couple of gallons for 150 people for three <b>days</b>,&rdquo; she says. How <b>did</b> the <b>Thanksgiving</b> menu evolve into what it is today?  Although prayers and thanks were probably offered at the 1621 harvest gathering, the first recorded religious Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth happened <b>two</b> years later in <b>1623</b>.

In 1620, about 100 religious Pilgrims left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-<b>day</b> southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  <b>In 1621</b>, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations in the...  While the settlers at Plymouth and their allies from the Wampanoag tribe really did get together <b>in</b> <b>1621</b> for a table-groaning, <b>three</b>-<b>day</b> feast to celebrate the settlers&#39; first harvest,...  The peace celebrated between the English and Wampanoag in 1621 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>last</b> <b>long</b>. Colonists sometimes celebrated days of thanksgiving to commemorate violence against Native enemies. In 1676, for example, a day of thanksgiving celebrated the grisly death of Ousamequin&rsquo;s son Pumetacom. 5 </p>        <p><a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/474.html">Thanksgiving guest gifts</a>. <a href="./497.html">Thanksgiving clip art otter</a>. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/24.html">Best turkey deals for thanksgiving michigan</a>.
