        <h2><strong>What country other than us celebrates thanksgiving Resturants near me for thanksgiving dinner</strong></h2>
        <p>From then on, when they celebrated Thanksgiving, the <b>Pilgrims</b> laid out five kernels of corn on each plate to remind themselves of their blessings. Let us remember: The first kernel reminds us of the autumn beauty all around us.  Bradford said that they would have considered <b>five</b> <b>kernels</b> of <b>corn</b> (or maize) as good as a feast! From then on, the legend says that they celebrated <b>Thanksgiving</b> by beginning their fest with <b>five</b> <b>kernels</b> of <b>corn</b> on their plate. What Each of the <b>Five</b> <b>Kernels</b> of <b>Corn</b> Represent: The <b>first</b> <b>kernel</b> reminds us of the Autumn beauty all around us.  The colony suddenly flourished, and by the fall of 1623, Bradford declared the <b>first</b> official day of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, very similar in appearance to the one held two years prior, out of thanks for God&rsquo;s sustaining hand through the previous year&rsquo;s starvation.  This <b>Thanksgiving</b>, start a new family tradition...5 <b>Kernels</b> of <b>Corn</b>. Free Printable included! Add an educational element to Thanksgiving!  At a Thanksgiving celebration that fall, the first course was different: An empty plate with <b>5</b> <b>kernels</b> of <b>corn</b> was placed before each person. The pilgrims stood up one by one and shared five things for which they were thankful.  In our home, we set out <b>five</b> <b>kernels</b> of <b>corn</b> at each place around the table, sharing the story passed down through generations. These five simple <b>kernels</b> have grown to become a cherished part of our <b>Thanksgiving</b> tradition in our home.  The story goes that once Thanksgiving became a holiday, the <b>Pilgrims</b> would start their meal with five kernels of corn on their plate. These five golden kernels represented all the pilgrims had to eat for the entire day during difficult winter.  The first kernel reminds us <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>loves</b> <b>us</b>. The second kernel reminds us that God provides for all our needs. The third kernel reminds us of the friends God has given us &mdash; just as the American Indians were friends to the pilgrims.  These <b>five</b> <b>kernels</b> of <b>corn</b> serve as a reminder of days when food was scarce and how God provides for our needs. Before the meal, each person removes each of the <b>five</b> <b>kernels</b> of corn from his or her plate and tells five things for which he or she has to be thankful. </p>        <p>Cute thanksgiving outfits for toddler boy.
