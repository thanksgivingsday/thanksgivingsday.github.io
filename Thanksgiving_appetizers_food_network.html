        <p>In the United <b>States</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is an annual tradition that was federally formalized by an 1863 by presidential proclamation by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, but was implemented as state legislation since the nation&#39;s founding. In 1941, federal legislation by the United <b>States</b> Congress formalized <b>Thanksgiving</b> on the fourth Thursday in November.  Festivals <b>of Thanksgiving</b> were observed sporadically on a local level for more than 150 years. They tended to be autumn harvest celebrations. But in 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day <b>of Thanksgiving</b> be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms.  It is intended to celebrate the blessings of the past year. <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day became an official <b>U.S</b>. holiday in 1863, and in 1942 the federal government designated the fourth Thursday in November as <b>Thanksgiving</b>. A traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> meal consists of turkey, cranberries, bread stuffing, and pumpkin pie, among other dishes.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> at Plymouth, oil on canvas by Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, 1925 National Museum of Women in the Arts. <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a federal holiday in the United <b>States</b> celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. [2]  In the modern consciousness, <b>Thanksgiving</b> is strongly associated with the near-mythological story of the Pilgrims at Plymouth (the English colonists) and their Wampanoag Indian neighbors, who shared a meal to celebrate the harvest in 1621. However, days <b>of thanksgiving</b> on a variety of occasions have been celebrated throughout American <b>history</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day is an annual national holiday in the United <b>States</b> and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving</b> is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  Plymouth Colony &amp; First <b>Thanksgiving</b>. The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of Puritan separatists (the pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the Mayflower to establish a profitable colony in Virginia.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is the annual holiday that takes place throughout the United <b>States</b> on the last Thursday of November. Typically associated with family get-togethers and feasts including turkey, cranberries, and pumpkin pie, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has a long <b>history</b> that dates as far back as the early settlers in Plymouth.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a <b>U.S</b>. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November.
