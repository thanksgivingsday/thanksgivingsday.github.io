        <p>Learn about the first encounter between the Pilgrims and Native Americans <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>, their surprising relationship, and the reason a United States president created...Read More --- The pilgrims...  For American culture, the story <b>of</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first <b>Thanksgiving</b>&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  It was President Lincoln who declared Thanksgiving a national celebration <b>in</b> <b>1863</b>. The Plymouth Pilgrims simply celebrated survival, as well as the hopes of good fortune in the years that lay ahead.  The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a U.S. holiday celebrated each year at the end of November. Learn about the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b>, facts about the Mayflower and the <b>Pilgrims</b>, and more.

Join me on a journey through time as we explore the real deal behind the first Thanksgiving and how it fits into the grand tapestry of big events in American history. Once upon a time, in the early <b>1600s</b>, there was a group of people from England who wanted to have religious freedom.  Pilgrims held their second Thanksgiving celebration <b>in</b> <b>1623</b> to mark the end of a long drought that had threatened the year&rsquo;s harvest and prompted Governor Bradford to call for a religious fast. </p>        <p>Zion lodge thanksgiving dinner reservations. <i>Thanksgiving history books</i>.
