        <h2><strong>Is macys thanksgiving parade a competition Thanksgiving day word find</strong></h2>
        <p>By <b>the </b>President of <b>the </b>United States of America. a Proclamation. Whereas it is <b>the </b>duty of all Nations to acknowledge <b>the </b>providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor&mdash;and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me &ldquo;to recommend to <b>the </b>People of <b>the </b>United States a day of public ...  Over the following decades and administrations, <b>Thanksgiving</b> was sporadically recognized on different dates (<b>National</b> Archives). On October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln <b>declared</b> that the last Thursday in November was to be recognized as a Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Obama White House). In 1870, Congress passed legislation making <b>Thanksgiving</b> a ...  <b>The First</b> <b>National</b> Proclamation of <b>Thanksgiving</b> was given by the Continental Congress in 1777 from its temporary location in York, Pennsylvania, while the British occupied the <b>national</b> capital at Philadelphia.  Commander of the Continental <b>Army</b>, <b>General</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> agreed, proclaiming December 18, 1777 as the first national thanksgiving day. The Continental Congress supported similar thanksgiving proclamations through 1784.  <b>President</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> was the first to issue a proclamation for the holiday in 1789, designating Thursday, November 26 &ldquo;for the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving. &rdquo; This marked the first national celebration of the holiday under the new Constitution.  On <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1789</b>, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November 26, <b>1789</b>, as an official holiday of &quot;sincere and humble thanks.&quot; The nation then celebrated its first Thanksgiving under its new Constitution.  Did you know <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> is responsible for our Thanksgiving holiday. It was our first president, not the Pilgrims and not Abraham Lincoln, who led the charge to make this day of thanks a truly national event.  A few days later, President <b>George</b> Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November <b>26</b>, <b>1789</b> as a &quot;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&quot; - the first time Thanksgiving was celebrated under the new Constitution.  After Lincoln&rsquo;s death in <b>1865</b>, <b>Andrew</b> <b>Johnson</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> first Thanksgiving proclamation designated the first Thursday in December as a national day of thanksgiving. But for the remainder of his Presidency, he chose the last Thursday in November to celebrate. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving business ecards. Como vestirse para thanksgiving.
