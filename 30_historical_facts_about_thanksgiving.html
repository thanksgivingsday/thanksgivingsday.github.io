Some of the most remembered passages on the giving of thanks are the following: &quot;Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, NKJV).  Although Thanksgiving has its historical roots in <b>religious</b> traditions, and has spiritual significance for many, today it is for most Americans a general secular holiday.
