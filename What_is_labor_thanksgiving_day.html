        <p>Thanksgiving in America may be a tradition dating back to the 17th century, but in <b>Germany</b> and the rest of Europe, harvest celebrations have been a fixture since pagan times. We take a look at the Erntedank harvest festival and explain why it&rsquo;s sometimes considered the &ldquo;Thanksgiving of <b>Germany</b>&rdquo;.  On the <b>Harvest</b> Festival, Germany comes alive with a variety of Thanksgiving parades. These parades feature floats decked out with flowers and motifs that resemble situations related to the harvest. In addition, participants carry a large crown designed for the parade, signifying gratitude.  The most popular Thanksgiving event in Germany is the annual Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> <b>Parade</b> in <b>Berlin</b>, which takes place on the first Saturday of October. This parade attracts thousands of spectators each year, who come to see the colorful floats, marching bands, and dance troupes.  (also known <b>as</b> Erntedankfest) translates to &ldquo; Harvest Thanksgiving.&rdquo; Like many harvest festivals across Europe, it traces its origins back to ancient agricultural rituals dedicated to giving thanks for a bountiful harvest season and seeking blessings for the forthcoming year&rsquo;s crops.  <b>Germany</b>&#39;s version of Thanksgiving is called Erntedankfest. What does this word actually mean, and what happens at a traditional German Erntedankfest?  The meaning of the German <b>Thanksgiving </b>(Erntedank), how it differs from <b>Thanksgiving </b>in North America and why it is still very important for us today!  A Thanksgiving procession is held at 2:00 pm and concludes with the presenting of the traditional &quot;harvest <b>crown</b>&quot; (Erntekrone). At 3:00 pm, there&#39;s music (&quot;von Blasmusik bis Jazz&quot;), dancing, and food inside and outside the church.  In <b>Germany</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,<b>Thanksgiving </b>Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched in German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first Sunday of October (04 October 2015 this year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  Eager to learn more about Thanksgiving In <b>Germany</b>? Then read on to know everything about one of the most fascinating harvest festivals in the world! Erntedankfest (&ldquo;give thanks for the harvest festival&ldquo;), is an annual celebration that happens around the time of the main harvest of a given region. </p>        <p>3660 on the rise thanksgiving menu.
