        <h2><strong>How to have thanksgiving dinner without a family blow up Indian thanksgiving meal</strong></h2>
        <p>What did they eat at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and how similar is it to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal today? Here&rsquo;s how Edward Winslow described the first Thanksgiving <b>feast</b> <b>in</b> a letter to a friend:  For most people, enjoying <b>turkey</b>, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b>, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b>, and <b>pumpkin</b> for Thanksgiving is as traditional and American as, well, <b>apple</b> <b>pie</b>. But how did the Pilgrims...  The meal consisted <b>of</b> <b>deer</b>, <b>corn</b>, <b>shellfish</b>, and roasted <b>meat</b>, different from today&#39;s traditional Thanksgiving feast. They played ball games, sang, and danced. Although prayers and thanks...  Today, the traditional <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner includes any number of dishes: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, candied yams, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.  <b>Turkey</b>, <b>corn</b>, and pumpkin pie are all Thanksgiving staples, but what did the pilgrims actually eat at the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The answer might surprise you!  From <b>seafood</b> to carrots, historians report that what was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> probably didn&#39;t include a lot of today&#39;s traditional favorites. The menu offers a fascinating glimpse at what life was like during the 1620s and how the celebration has changed over the years.  There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a <b>feast</b> of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn bread and porridge.  What you thought was eaten at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> is probably historically inaccurate. The feast featured autumnal <b>foods</b> native to Massachusetts.  Local vegetables that likely appeared on the table <b>include</b> <b>onions</b>, <b>beans</b>, <b>lettuce</b>, <b>spinach</b>, <b>cabbage</b>, <b>carrots</b> and <b>perhaps</b> <b>peas</b>. Corn, which records show was plentiful at the... </p>        <p>Easy unique thanksgiving dessert recipes. Glee thanksgiving homeward. Are stores open on thanksgiving in toronto.
