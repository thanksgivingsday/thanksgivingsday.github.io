        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving science studies Thanksgiving vocabulary esl beginner</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Thanksgiving </b>Day is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans generally believe that their <b>Thanksgiving </b>is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the European colonists (<b>Pilgrims</b>) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.  <b>Pilgrims</b> held their second Thanksgiving celebration in 1623 to mark the end of a long drought that had threatened the year&rsquo;s harvest and prompted Governor Bradford to call for a religious fast.  While the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans did break bread together, that&#39;s not the end of the story. Here&#39;s the real story of Thanksgiving&#39;<b>s</b> history.  The thanksgiving at St. Augustine was celebrated 56 years before the Puritan <b>Pilgrim</b> thanksgiving at Plymouth Plantation (Massachusetts), but it did not become the origin of a national annual tradition.  The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall <b>of</b> <b>1621</b>.  In 1620, about 100 religious <b>Pilgrims</b> left England on the Mayflower for the &quot;New World&quot; and landed in modern-day southeastern Massachusetts, a region inhabited by the Wampanoag people.  But the first Thanksgiving in 1621, shared between the <b>Pilgrims</b> of the Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag people, looked quite different&mdash;and its significance runs deeper than the food on the table.  In the Fall of 1621, the <b>Pilgrims</b> famously shared a harvest feast with the Pokanokets; the meal is now considered the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday. It took place over three days between...  The first <b>Thanksgiving </b>was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims </b>of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written. </p>        <p><a href="./671.html">Charlie brown history of thanksgiving</a>.
