        <p>When did the <b>NFL</b> start playing games on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The every-year tradition of playing <b>football</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, <b>NFL</b> style, dates back to 1934 when the Detroit Spartans hosted the World Champion Chicago Bears. <b>What NFL</b> <b>teams</b> always <b>play</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys traditionally always <b>play</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  According to the Pro <b>Football</b> Hall of Fame, the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>football</b> games were held on Nov. 25, 1920. Six games were supposedly <b>played</b> that <b>day</b>, and an urban legend states that the Chicago Tigers and Decatur Staleys challenged each other to a <b>Thanksgiving</b> duel in Chicago in the league&rsquo;s inaugural season.  <b>San</b> Francisco likewise played their first Thanksgiving game since 1972 in 2011. The Los Angeles Chargers, who last played on the holiday in 1969 (while the team was still an AFL franchise in San Diego), appeared for the first time as an NFL member in 2017. [50]  In 1934, the NFL played its first Thanksgiving <b>game</b>. The Detroit Lions would welcome the Chicago Bears to a feast on Thanksgiving.

When the <b>NFL</b> as we ...  Which NFL team has played the most games on Thanksgiving Day? The <b>Detroit</b> <b>Lions</b> have played 83 games on Thanksgiving Day, which is the most of any team. They&#39;ve played all of the games at home, and their overall record is 37-44-2.  Thirty-two years later, the Cowboys joined as a home <b>team</b>: The Cowboys first played on Thanksgiving in 1966, beating the Cleveland Browns 26-14 at the Cotton Bowl. General manager Tex Schramm ...  However, when it comes to <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>football</b>, <b>NFL</b> style, most fans <b>first</b> think of the Lions and the tradition that was started in 1934. It was their <b>first</b> year in Detroit after a local radio executive, George A. Richards, had purchased the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans and moved the <b>team</b> to Detroit.  With the exception of 1939-44 during World War II, the Lions have hosted a <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> <b>game</b> every year since 1934.
