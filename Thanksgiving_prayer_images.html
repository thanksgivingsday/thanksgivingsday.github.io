Discover Thanks-Giving Square in <b>Dallas</b>, Texas: A serene temple with stunning stained glass hides in downtown Dallas.  Thanks Giving Square is an urban garden in downtown <b>Dallas</b>. Set fifteen feet below ground level with a four foot wall blocking the sound of cars and the Dart rail that run nearby, it is meditative and serene space that inspires gratitude.  Thanks-Giving Square has been a magnificent and important part of downtown <b>Dallas </b>for over 40 years. Centered around the virtue of gratitude, the founders employed one of the most influential architects/designers of the day, Philip Johnson.  Built in 1976 to celebrate the United State&#39;s Bicentennial, Thanks-Giving Square was envisioned as a place of worship, meditation, mindfulness, and spirituality for those living and working in <b>Dallas</b>. It offers a respite from the stress of the city. It&#39;s also a one-of-a-kind work of art.  Thanks-Giving Square in <b>Dallas </b>was founded by a group of businessmen and religious leaders in 1964. The city had a history, going back to at least the early 1900s, of ecumenical religious celebrations between Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in the downtown area.  It seems like a good day to look back at Thanks-Giving Square, the triangular one-acre park in downtown <b>Dallas</b> bounded by Pacific, Bryan, and Ervay. It was originally envisioned in 1961 by <b>Dallas</b> businessman Peter Stewart as a needed quiet refuge and chapel in the middle of a busy city &mdash; a calm space set aside for &ldquo;spiritual gratitude.&rdquo; </p>        <p>Thanksgiving dinner alternatives.
