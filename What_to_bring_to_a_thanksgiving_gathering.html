        <h2><strong>What to bring to a thanksgiving gathering Thanksgiving thankful friends</strong></h2>
        <p>Bread: <b>Sturdy</b> <b>loaves</b> with a tight crumb (no large air holes) make the best bread for stuffing. Sourdough, Italian, and French breads are all great options, but avoid baguettes (too chewy) and sandwich breads (too soft). Make sure the loaf is unsliced so you can tear or cut it yourself.  This <b>stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b> is easy to make with bread cubes, butter, onion, celery, sage, and thyme for a crowd-pleasing addition to your <b>Thanksgiving</b> table.  Martha&rsquo;s classic <b>stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b> is moist on the inside, crisp and golden on the outside, and designed to feed a large crowd. Its savory flavor comes from a generous amount of saut&eacute;ed onion and celery plus plenty of fresh parsley and sage.  This is our go to <b>recipe</b> for <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>stuffing</b>. It&rsquo;s a hit every year. I&rsquo;ve made it with homemade bread <b>cubes</b>, store bought bakery bread <b>cubes</b>, and packaged Oroweat/Pepperidge Farm bread <b>cubes</b>.  When it comes to <b>Thanksgiving</b> sides, our turkey <b>stuffing</b> is always on the must-make list. Whether you call it <b>stuffing</b> or dressing, this traditional <b>stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b> is a crowd-pleasing classic for holiday gatherings, boasting the perfect blend of herbs, pillowy soft bread, butter, and fresh veggies. Our favorite part?  We typically serve two different stuffings for Thanksgiving &ndash; a sausage <b>cornbread</b> <b>stuffing</b> (omg, my favorite!) and a traditional bread stuffing with just onions, celery and seasonings. Most of us take a little bit of each, while others aren&rsquo;t a fan of the sausage, so they load up on the classic version.  Homemade <b>Stuffing</b> is a staple side dish for every <b>Thanksgiving</b> table! This is a traditional recipe made with dried bread cubes mixed with onions and celery sauteed in plenty of butter then mixed with herbs and broth (and more butter) and baked until golden and delicious! WANT TO SAVE THIS RECIPE?!  Over ten years in, our best <b>stuffing</b> <b>recipe</b> remains one of our favorite <b>Thanksgiving</b> sides. It delivers a crispy golden top and custardy center every time.  We recommend using crusty bread such as a sourdough loaf. Our secret ingredient as it is already perfectly seasoned! Italian sausage is also a great option. A must-have in all your holiday <b>recipes</b>. Keeping it real with all the classic ingredients, all cooked in butter until fragrant and tender. </p>        <p><a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/765.html">Thanksgiving color by number for preschool</a>.
