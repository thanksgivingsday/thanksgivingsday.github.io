        <h2><strong>Dinner places open thanksgiving eugene Thanksgiving history simple</strong></h2>
        <p>Let me give one example. In 1 Chronicles 16, David has a song of <b>thanksgiving </b>sung to God. The first few verses start: 8 Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples! 9 Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!  We come to share the Body and Blood of God, the Body and Blood of Christ, with the Body of Christ. And the classic name for this event we&rsquo;re sharing? The Eucharist. Eucharisteo. <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Coming to this table should form within us thankfulness. So what are we here to be thankful for? Everything. Our very existence is not ours; He has made us.  Some call it <b>communion</b>. Others refer to it as the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, while some refer to it as eucharist. Any are appropriate, but each holds different meaning. The latter comes from the Greek word eucharisteo [pronounced yoo-khar-is-teh&rsquo;-o], which means to be grateful and to give thanks.  Renew our <b>communion</b> with your Church throughout the world, and strengthen it in every nation and among every people to witness faithfully in your name. By your Spirit make us one with Christ, one with each other, and one in ministry to all the world, until Christ comes in final victory, and we feast at his heavenly banquet.  Renew our <b>communion</b> with all your saints, especially those whom we name before you&mdash; Name(s) &mdash;(in our hearts). Silence may be kept for the remembrance of names. Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, strengthen us to run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the Pioneer and Perfecter of our faith.  A <b>communion</b> <b>prayer</b> includes thanksgiving for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice and requesting God&rsquo;s grace and guidance. When Christians partake in communion, they commemorate the Last Supper Jesus had with His disciples before He was crucified.  <b>Communion</b> is <b>an</b> act of <b>pure</b> thanksgiving. It is a time to give thanks for the greatest gift and sacrifice ever made, the death (and life) of Jesus on your behalf. A picture of the Gospel, an exchange of lives. 1. Turn upward &ndash; spend time daily praising and thanking God for who He is, what He has done, and what He means in your life. 2.  Thanksgiving Prayer: &quot;We <b>thank</b> <b>you</b>, <b>Lord</b>, for this precious gift of <b>Communion</b>. As we partake of the bread and wine, may we be filled with your love and grace, and may we be strengthened to go forth and share your light with the world.&quot;  The people are then directed by bulletin or announcement to UMH 15&ndash;16 for the Thanksgiving and <b>Communion</b>, which they follow while the pastor prays the Great Thanksgiving in one of the following forms: 1) The Great Thanksgiving in A Service of Word and Table I or II (see UMH 13&ndash;14) 2) One of the seasonal or alternate Great Thanksgivings </p>        <p>Best washington wines for thanksgiving.
