        <h2><strong>What determines the date of thanksgiving each year Foods for kindergarten thanksgiving feast</strong></h2>
        <p>When a <b>company</b> decides to close <b>on Thanksgiving</b> Day or for the entire week between <b>Christmas</b> and New Year&rsquo;s Day, is the employer required to compensate any of its <b>employees</b>? For non-exempt (overtime-eligible <b>employees</b>), the <b>company</b> is generally not required to pay <b>employees</b> on days in which they do not perform <b>work</b>.  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require payment for time not <b>worked</b>, such as vacations or holidays (federal or otherwise). These benefits are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and an employee (or the employee&#39;s representative).  In this article, we discuss <b>working</b> on holidays, list the standard paid holidays and review the benefits of <b>working</b> on these days. Do <b>employees</b> earn extra pay to <b>work</b> on holidays? The amount that you earn during the holidays depends on what&#39;s agreed to between you and your employer.  At most U.S. companies, employees have a paid day off from work on Thanksgiving so they can spend time with the people who matter most. The day after Thanksgiving, also known <b>as</b> <b>Black</b> Friday,...  With the holiday season approaching, employers may be considering whether they have to provide <b>employees</b> with paid time off for holidays, or extra pay when they work on a holiday. Here we answer these and other frequently asked questions about holiday pay.  Holiday leaves allow <b>employees</b> to take time off on a few specific occasions for fulfilling certain religious or traditional obligations. Typically, the federal and state government predetermine certain days as holidays. Employees can take either paid or unpaid time off on the predefined days based on the company policy.  The most popular paid holidays were <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>and Christmas</b> Day, with 97% of <b>employees</b> in private businesses receiving this benefit. The least common paid days off were Veterans Day (11%) and Washington&rsquo;s Birthday/President&rsquo;s Day (19%).  Holiday pay laws should be closely followed by all <b>companies</b> open for business on state or federal holidays. 3 min read. Specifically, federal law does not require employers to pay their employees additional compensation (i.e., time and a half) for working on a holiday.  With the current economic crisis, many employers are considering giving workers additional unpaid time off during the holidays. This includes giving workers Friday, November 28 (the day after <b>Thanksgiving</b>) and/or Friday, December 26 (the day after <b>Christmas</b>) off without pay. </p>        <p>Festival foods thanksgiving run.
