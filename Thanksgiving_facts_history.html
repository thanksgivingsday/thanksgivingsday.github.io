        <p>Known as Korean Thanksgiving <b>internationally</b>, Chuseok is a joyful holiday for Koreans. Let&rsquo;s find out all you need to know about the Korean Thanksgiving. What Is Chuseok? What Does &ldquo;Chuseok&rdquo; Mean? When Is Chuseok? How to Say &ldquo;Happy Chuseok&rdquo; in Korean? What Are Chuseok Traditions? What Is Popular Chuseok Food?  Chuseok is commonly incorrectly translated as &quot;<b>Korean</b> Thanksgiving&quot; in American English despite the holidays being vastly different in origin and <b>celebration</b>. [8][9] Although most South Koreans visit their families and ancestral homes, there are festivities held at the National Folk Museum of <b>Korea</b>.  Chuseok (추석) also known as Hangawi (한가위) is a major harvest festival celebrated in South Korea. It&#39;s a time for families to come together, pay respects to their ancestors, and enjoy traditional foods like songpyeon (rice cakes). The festival is a gratitude for a good harvest and is generally considered as Thanksgiving. When is Chuseok?  Chuseok, also known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b>, is one of South <b>Korea</b>&rsquo;s most cherished and significant holidays. If you&rsquo;re planning a visit to Seoul during Chuseok, quite some places will be closed as Koreans visit their families &ndash; similar to our Christmas holidays..  Chuseok (추석) &ndash; otherwise known as Hangawi (한가위) by Koreans or as &ldquo;Korean Thanksgiving&rdquo; by Westerners &ndash; is one of the most significant public holidays in Korea, together with Seollal or the Korean New Year (설날).  We are celebrating Chuseok, one of the most important holidays on the Korean calendar and known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day. <b>In </b>this piece, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the dazzling kaleidoscope that is this extraordinary festival.  Chuseok <b>is</b> known as the Korean thanksgiving festival all over the world. The festival takes place during the harvest and is also known as the mid-autumn festival. This chuseok holiday korea is celebrated all over the country with utter joy and enthusiasm. The simplest chuseok meaning is the evening of autumn.  Chuseok, also known as Korean <b>Thanksgiving </b>Day, is one of the most important and festive holidays of the year. This year, Chuseok falls on Thursday, September 19th, but the holiday period actually lasts for three days <b>in </b>total &ndash; including the day before and after Chuseok.  Chuseok (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the Korean calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to Thanksgiving, this festival is observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving quotes for teachers day.
