        <p><b>Celebration</b> of the Norse New Year; a festival of 12 nights. This is the most important of all the Norse holidays. On the night of December 20, the god Ingvi Freyr rides over the earth on the back of his shining boar, bringing Light and Love back into the World.  For the first time since 2000, the Minnesota <b>Vikings</b> will be taking to the field on <b>Thanksgiving</b> when they travel to Ford Field to take on the Detroit Lions.

Frey Feast or Freysblot (August 1st): <b>thanksgiving</b> for the fruits of the first harvest of the year. A loaf of bread is baked as an offering to the god Frey.  The <b>celebration</b> of <b>Thanksgiving</b> in Norway differs. In name, it&rsquo;s nearly the same: H&oslash;sttakkefest translates directly to &ldquo;Harvest <b>Thanksgiving</b> Feast.&rdquo; But its roots are older and reflect both religious and secular tradition.  The <b>Vikings</b>, like many other pagan cultures, celebrated particular holidays that marked different periods of the year. Prior to the Christianization in the early medieval period, the most important Viking holidays were based on the lunisolar calendar. </p>        <p>Colors for thanksgiving.
