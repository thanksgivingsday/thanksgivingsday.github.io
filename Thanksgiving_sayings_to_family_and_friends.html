        <p>&quot;Most of today&#39;s classic <b>Thanksgiving</b> dishes weren&#39;t served in 1621,&quot; says Curtin. &quot;These traditional holiday dishes became part of the menu after 1700.  Only 5 percent of this <b>food</b> was served at the <b>first Thanksgiving</b>. There are only two surviving documents that reference the original <b>Thanksgiving</b> harvest meal. They describe a feast of freshly killed deer, assorted wildfowl, a bounty of cod and bass, and flint, a native variety of corn harvested by the Native Americans, which was eaten as corn ...  What <b>Did</b> the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>Eat</b>? Today, we <b>eat</b> turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and vegetables as the base feast for our Thanksgivings. We also tend to have lots of pies and bread. We often see this same feast depicted in &ldquo;historical&rdquo; representations of the holiday. It has gotten to the point that turkeys are like the Easter bunnies of ...  When we think of <b>Thanksgiving</b> meats, turkey is top of mind for most of us, and indeed the <b>Pilgrims</b> <b>did</b> <b>eat</b> turkey in 1621, as reported by Plymouth governor William Bradford. Most of the fowl shot by Pilgrim and Native hunters, though, were ducks and geese, as Plymouth lies on a bustling migratory flyway , and waterfowl would have been plentiful ...  Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these staples were part of the harvest celebration shared by the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony ...  What historical records say about what was served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Two primary sources&mdash;the only surviving documents that reference the meal&mdash;confirm that these dietary staples were ...  <b>Pilgrims</b>&rsquo; <b>First</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Recipes. If you&rsquo;re looking to make history with this year&rsquo;s holiday meal, these recipes based on <b>foods</b> from the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> may give you the opportunity to do just that. While clearly not replicating recipes and procedures of the era, they are delicious just the same! Pumpkin Shell Custard. Ingredients:  There&rsquo;s a good chance the <b>Pilgrims</b> and Wampanoag <b>did</b> in fact <b>eat</b> turkey as part of that very <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Wild turkey was a common <b>food</b> source for people who settled Plymouth. In the days prior to the celebration, the colony&rsquo;s governor sent four men to go &ldquo;fowling&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to hunt for birds. <b>Did</b> they come back with any turkey?  Back in 2003, we consulted with historians at Plimoth Plantation, the Wampanoag and English settlers living history museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and asked writer Jane Walsh to devise a menu that incorporated some of the <b>foods</b> that would have been served at the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>. We didn&rsquo;t eliminate any favorites or try to go sugar-free. </p>        <p>Happy holidays thanksgiving images. Thanksgiving movie netflix streaming.
