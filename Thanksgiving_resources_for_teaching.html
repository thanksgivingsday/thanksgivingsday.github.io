        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving resources for teaching Quotes about thanksgiving from presidents</strong></h2>
        <p>The University of Michigan made it a tradition to play annual Thanksgiving <b>games</b>, holding 19 such games from 1885 to 1905. The Thanksgiving Day <b>games</b> between Michigan and the Chicago Maroons in the 1890s have been erroneously cited as &quot;The Beginning of Thanksgiving <b>Day</b> <b>Football</b>.&quot;  When did the NFL start playing <b>games</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The every-year tradition of playing <b>football</b> on <b>Thanksgiving</b>, NFL style, dates back to 1934 when the Detroit Spartans hosted the World Champion Chicago Bears. What NFL teams always play on <b>Thanksgiving</b>? The Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys traditionally always play on <b>Thanksgiving</b>.  For many, pumpkin pie and turkey are just a background to the big <b>game</b>. How did this tradition grow to become what it is today? <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a time for yummy food, friends and family, the Macy&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> Parade, giving thanks, and most importantly, watching <b>football</b>.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>football</b> dates to at least 1876, when Yale defeated Princeton, 2-0, on a cold, bleak afternoon in Hoboken, New Jersey. By the 1890s, many college and high school teams played on...  As the late, great John Madden put it, &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving</b> and <b>football</b>. Some things just go together greatly.&rdquo; While it may seem like the NFL and <b>Thanksgiving</b> have always gone together, that&rsquo;s not exactly the case. The NFL began in 1920, but the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>game</b> didn&rsquo;t occur until 14 years later.  Whether you center your entire <b>day</b> around the <b>game</b> or it is what is on in the background while you mindlessly scroll on your phone after dinner, <b>football</b> is as much of a <b>Thanksgiving</b> tradition as turkey in many households. But, why? Long before <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>football</b> was an NFL thing, it was a tradition among college teams.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b> to sports fans is as much about <b>football</b> as it is about the <b>traditional</b> turkey dinner. From high school <b>football</b> in the morning to watching the afternoon game on TV as...  The key <b>game</b> in the title drive came on <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>Day</b>, when the Lions defeated the Bears 14-2 to clinch the West championship. Thus the <b>football</b>-on-<b>Thanksgiving</b> tradition became firmly established in Detroit.  Every year, millions tune in to watch the annual <b>Thanksgiving</b> NFL <b>games</b>, but how did football become so connected to the holiday? </p>        <p>Thanksgiving village lehi utah.
