        <h2><strong>Volunteer for thanksgiving st louis Home made bread thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>Free Thanksgiving dinners and <b>turkeys</b> Food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and faith groups are here to make the holiday season brighter. If you are looking for food, Thanksgiving meals are available to help make this holiday season a time of joy and togetherness.  Food banks purchase a lot of food in bulk and at reduced wholesale prices. So, the money you would spend on a <b>turkey</b> might be more efficiently used as a <b>donation</b> to the food bank since they could buy a lot more food with it than an individual could at a local store. So, do food banks distribute them if I can&rsquo;t <b>donate</b> a Thanksgiving <b>turkey</b>? Yes!  For neighbors with homes, the community centers provide <b>turkeys</b> and all the side dishes so families can enjoy holiday meals together without the financial strain of expensive grocery bills. Basic services are essential to those who can&#39;t afford to put food on the table or don&#39;t have access to hot meals while homeless.  By joining our Thanksgiving Fund Drive, you&rsquo;ll help Catholic Charities of <b>New York</b> provide delicious <b>turkey</b> with all the fixings and other critical care to many who would otherwise go without this Thanksgiving. Your <b>donation</b> of just $65 can provide a food basket of 10 meals <b>for</b> Thanksgiving! Please help a family in need now.  By choosing one of <b>New York City</b>&rsquo;s largest food pantries serving some of <b>NYC</b>&rsquo;s hardest-hit neighborhoods (BedStuy/Brownsville/East <b>New York</b>), we strive to provide enough <b>turkeys</b> this Thanksgiving so that no one is turned away hungry from The Campaign Against Hunger, a 501-c-3 that feeds hundreds of families each day.  &ldquo;With Thanksgiving Day just around the corner, we are excited and pleased to join Food Bank For <b>New York City</b> who is committed to doing their part to address food insecurity by donating 83,000 <b>turkeys</b> and chickens to 700 community-based organizations that will help our most vulnerable residents during the holiday season,&rdquo; said Bronx Borough ...  Last year, City Harvest donated 12,000 <b>turkeys</b> and this year, they will deliver 30,000 more pounds of <b>turkey</b> than the year prior. Photo by Lori Cannava For this year&rsquo;s annual week-long event, Repack to Give Back, City Harvest staff members packaged enormous amounts of holiday-themed meal packs including canned goods and produce to <b>donate</b>.  Additionally, use Food Help <b>NYC</b> finder to locate closest soup kitchens and food pantries https://finder.<b>nyc</b>.gov/foodhelp/ Call Emergency Food Hotline at 866-888-8777 or dial 311. THE BRONX. Super Tuesday Thanksgiving Service - Dream Life Church. What: Free 10-13 pound <b>turkey</b> with fixings. When: Tuesday, November 26th, 4:00 - 8:00 PM  Over the past 23 years, FeedingNY has hand-delivered over 100,000 boxes with all the ingredients for a Thanksgiving family meal&mdash;from <b>turkey</b> to fixins&rsquo;.
