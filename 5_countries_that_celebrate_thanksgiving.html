        <h2><strong>5 countries that celebrate thanksgiving Reflections of thanksgiving by sandra eithun</strong></h2>
        <p>On October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln <b>declared</b> that the last Thursday in November was to be recognized as a Day of <b>Thanksgiving</b> (Obama White House). In 1870, Congress passed legislation making <b>Thanksgiving</b> a <b>holiday</b>, but gave the president discretion to declare the date that the <b>holiday</b> would be celebrated.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>6</b>, <b>1941</b>, the House passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day. The Senate, however, amended the resolution establishing the holiday as the fourth Thursday, which would take into account those years when November has five Thursdays.  Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday in the United States, and, in 2024, falls on Thursday, <b>November</b> <b>28</b>. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people...  Caleb Strong, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, declared the holiday in <b>1813</b>, &quot;for a day of public thanksgiving and prayer&quot; for Thursday, November 25 of that year. [ 45 ] Madison also declared the holiday twice in 1815; however, neither of these was celebrated in autumn.  The colonists of <b>the</b> Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of thanksgiving for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native Americans as the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday which many observe as a Day of Mourning and reflection.  President Zachary Taylor said <b>around</b> <b>1849</b> that it was up to the states to decide when and whether to declare a Thanksgiving holiday; in that period, such a holiday was often celebrated anywhere...  This was just the third federal <b>holiday</b> to be <b>declared</b>. Only Independence Day and Washington&rsquo;s birthday are older. <b>Thanksgiving</b> didn&rsquo;t become a national <b>holiday</b> until the height of the Civil War in 1863, when President Lincoln issued a proclamation urging Americans to ask God to &ldquo;heal the wounds of the nation.&rdquo;  <b>On</b> <b>October</b> <b>3</b>, <b>1863</b>, during the Civil War, Lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving to be celebrated on Thursday, November 26. The holiday was annually proclaimed by every president thereafter, and the date chosen, with few exceptions, was the last Thursday in November. </p>        <p>Daves market thanksgiving seniors.
