        <p><b>Canada</b>&rsquo;s <b>Thanksgiving</b> Traditions. <b>Thanksgiving</b>, in some form or another, has been a part of Canadian life since the mid-19th Century.

To begin with, Canadians may thank American refugees who fled to <b>Canada</b> after the Civil War for introducing the annual <b>thanksgiving</b> celebration. Since its inception in 1879, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated annually, though on varying dates and with varying emphasis. Blessings of a bountiful harvest were a regular refrain for many years.  The first national <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>in Canada</b> was celebrated in the Province of <b>Canada</b> in 1859. It was organized at the behest of leaders of the Protestant clergy, who appropriated the holiday of American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, which was first observed in 1777 and established as a national day of &ldquo;public <b>thanksgiving</b> and prayer&rdquo; in 1789. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving childrens stories utube.
