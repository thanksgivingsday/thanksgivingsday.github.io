        <h2><strong>Cute thanksgiving gifts for friends Thanksgiving easy treats</strong></h2>
        <p>Chuseok (추석), also known as Hangawi, marks a zenith in the <b>Korean</b> calendar, rivaling only the lunar New Year in its cultural significance. Often likened to <b>Thanksgiving</b>, this festival is observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, typically aligning with September or October by the Gregorian reckoning.  This weekend in <b>Korea</b> we are celebrating Chuseok (<b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b>). So in light of the Chuseok holiday weekend, it seems a bit cliche but I just wanted to remind us to give thanks for all that God has done and is currently doing in our midst.  We are celebrating Chuseok, one of the most important holidays on the <b>Korean</b> calendar and known as <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day. In this piece, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the dazzling kaleidoscope that is this extraordinary festival.  Whether it be eating songpyeon or watching traditional musical performances, foreigners in Seoul and across Korea are invited to participate in <b>Korean</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> celebrations. So this is how Chuseok, or Korean <b>Thanksgiving</b> is spent in Korea: with family among charye, seongmyo and songpyeon.  Chusok, <b>Korea</b>&rsquo;s annual thanksgiving holiday, is one of the biggest migration events in modern Korea. Over half of the population visits families and ancestral graves during the three-day holiday, which usually falls sometime in September or October.  How to Say &ldquo;<b>Happy</b> <b>Chuseok</b>&rdquo; in Korean? On Seollal, &ldquo;새해 복 많이 받으세요 /sae-hae bok ma-ni ba-deu-se-yo/&rdquo; is the traditional greeting. But, there are no specific greetings for Chuseok. The most common Chuseok greeting would be &ldquo;추석 잘 보내세요 /chu-seok jal bo-nae-se-yo/,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;have a good Chuseok.&rdquo;  <b>Chuseok</b>, also known as <b>Korean</b> Thanksgiving Day, is one of the most important and festive holidays of the year. This year, Chuseok falls on Thursday, September 19th, but the holiday period actually lasts for three days in total &ndash; including the day before and after Chuseok.  <b>Chuseok</b> (추석), also known as Hangawi (한가위), is typically considered &ldquo;Korean Thanksgiving.&rdquo; It is one of the two biggest holidays in Korea and is celebrated according to the lunar calendar, so the exact dates differ from year to year.  <b>Chuseok</b> (추석), or hangawi (한가위), is one of the biggest holidays in South Korea. It&rsquo;s a time when families gather together to give thanks to their ancestors for an abundant autumn harvest. Sometimes called Korean Thanksgiving, Chuseok is celebrated with good food, wine, and family gatherings. </p>        <p>Thanksgiving stuffing hash. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/597.html">Chandler az restaurants open thanksgiving</a>.
