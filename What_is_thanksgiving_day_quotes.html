        <h2><strong>What is thanksgiving day quotes What is open today toronto thanksgiving</strong></h2>
        <p>President George Washington was the first to issue a proclamation for the holiday in 1789, designating Thursday, November <b>26</b> &ldquo;for the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving. &rdquo; This marked the first national celebration of the holiday under the new Constitution.  The <b>Friday</b> after Thanksgiving is a state holiday in California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.  On June 28, 1870, <b>President</b> Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly &quot;appointed or remembered&quot; federal holiday in Washington D.C. Three other holidays included in the law were New Year , Christmas , and July 4.  Is the day after Thanksgiving a Federal Holiday? No, the day after Thanksgiving (often called Black <b>Friday</b>) is not a federal holiday. Federal employees must use accrued personal time to take off the day after thanksgiving if they wish to be off work.  The day after Thanksgiving Day has come to be known as &ldquo;<b>Black</b> <b>Friday</b>,&rdquo; the unofficial first day of holiday shopping in the U.S.  In the event the President issues an Executive order granting a &quot;<b>half</b>-day&quot; holiday, employees on a flexible work schedule are entitled to holiday premium pay for work during the last half of their &quot;basic work requirement&quot; (i.e., non-overtime hours) on that day, not to exceed 4 hours.  Now, some feds are feeling a bit greedy it seems, sending <b>President </b>Obama a new <b>holiday </b>request: closing the <b>federal </b>government on the <b>day after Thanksgiving</b>. A petition on the White House&rsquo;s &ldquo;We...  Five of the &quot;floating&quot; date holidays always fall on a Monday; the remaining floating holiday, Thanksgiving, is always on a <b>Thursday</b>. The rest are on fixed dates.  It is why in the midst of the Civil War &mdash; in proclaiming the <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>holiday</b> we now celebrate today &mdash; Abraham Lincoln urged us to remember our &ldquo;fruitful fields and healthful skies.&rdquo; </p>        <p>Downloadable thanksgiving clip art. 2024 live stream thanksgiving day parade.
