        <h2><strong>Government offices open day after thanksgiving Thanksgiving kendrick lamar</strong></h2>
        <p>In this article I take a brief look at the origins of <b>Thanksgiving</b> and its celebration here in <b>Canada</b>, given that we will all be celebrating on October 14 th. We all learned as children about the American <b>Thanksgiving</b> myth of the first US <b>Thanksgiving</b> but what of the early Canadian celebrations.  Some historians argue that the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> in North America took place in <b>Canada</b> in 1578, following Martin Frobisher&rsquo;s safe arrival in Newfoundland after a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Even earlier, Indigenous Peoples had their own traditions for honoring the Earth&rsquo;s abundance during the fall season.  Thanksgiving in Canada originated purely as <b>a</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>festival</b>. On January 31, 1957, the Canadian Parliament proclaimed: A Day of General Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed &ndash; to be observed on the 2nd Monday in October. English explorer Martin Frobisher hosted the first Canadian ...  Canadian Thanksgiving kicked off with a feast of biscuits, salt beef, and mushy peas in 1578. That&rsquo;s when Sir Martin Frobisher sailed from England in search of the <b>Northwest</b> Passage.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> (French: Action de gr&acirc;ce) or <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day (French: Jour de l&#39;Action de gr&acirc;ce), is an annual Canadian holiday held on the second Monday in October. [1] Outside the country, it may be referred to as Canadian <b>Thanksgiving</b> to distinguish it from the American holiday of the same name and related celebrations in other regions .  The first official, annual Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated <b>on</b> <b>6</b> <b>November</b> <b>1879</b>, though Indigenous peoples in Canada have a history of celebrating the fall harvest that predates the arrival of European settlers.  Days of thanksgiving in Canada also originated in the <b>colonial</b> <b>period</b>, arising from the same European traditions, in gratitude for safe journeys, peace, and bountiful harvests.  The first large, national <b>Thanksgiving</b> in <b>Canada</b> was celebrated in 1859 in what was then called the province of <b>Canada</b>. The province of <b>Canada</b> was developed when Upper <b>Canada</b> and Lower <b>Canada</b> were united by Britain in 1841.  The first Thanksgiving in Canada has been credited to English explorer Martin Frobisher. According to historical records, he celebrated in 1578 in what we now know as <b>Newfoundland</b>. The first official Thanksgiving was celebrated on Nov. 6, 1879. </p>        <p>Do canada celebrate thanksgiving. Pizza delivery on thanksgiving 2024. Child birthday party thank you wording.
