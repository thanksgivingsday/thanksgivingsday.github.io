        <h2><strong>In prayer and supplication with thanksgiving Thanksgiving ideas entertaining</strong></h2>
        <p><b>The</b> <b>Harvest</b> <b>Festival</b> in Germany is similar&mdash;but not identical&mdash;to Thanksgiving in the United States. It&rsquo;s a holiday to celebrate the autumn Ernte (&ldquo;harvest&rdquo;), as well as show appreciation to God and people working in Landwirtschaft (&ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;).  Today, Thanksgiving is <b>celebrated</b> in many parts of <b>Germany</b>, with customs and traditions that are unique to each region. From parades and feasts to gift-giving and charity events, Thanksgiving has become a beloved holiday in <b>Germany</b> that brings people together to give thanks and <b>celebrate</b> the harvest season.  <b>In Germany</b>, <b>Thanksgiving</b>&mdash; (&ldquo;das Erntedankfest,&rdquo; i.e.,<b>Thanksgiving </b>Harvest Festival)&mdash;is strongly entrenched <b>in </b>German culture. Erntedankfest is usually observed on the first Sunday of October (04 October 2015 this year), although the timing is not hard and fast nationwide.  In <b>Germany</b>, Erntedankfest (literally translated &ldquo;thanks for the harvest festival&ldquo;) is a religious holiday, and is celebrated both in the Catholic and Protestant churches. The alter is decorated with sheaves of wheat, and the fruits of the harvest.  <b>Thanksgiving in </b>America may be a tradition dating back to the 17th century, but <b>in Germany </b>and the rest of Europe, harvest celebrations have been a fixture since pagan times. We take a look at the Erntedank harvest festival and explain why it&rsquo;s sometimes considered the &ldquo;<b>Thanksgiving </b>of <b>Germany</b>&rdquo;.  Erntedankfest (&ldquo;give thanks for the harvest festival&ldquo;), is an annual celebration that happens around the time of the main harvest of a given region. The festival is a religious holiday, and it&rsquo;s <b>celebrated </b>both <b>in </b>the Catholic and Protestant churches <b>in Germany </b>with bustling parades, music, dancing, church services, and typical food.  The meaning of the German <b>Thanksgiving </b>(Erntedank), how it differs from <b>Thanksgiving in </b>North America and why it is still very important for us today!  In German-speaking countries, Erntedankfest is often celebrated on the first <b>Sunday</b> in October, which is usually also the first Sunday following Michaelistag or Michaelmas (29 Sept.), but various locales may give thanks at different times during September and October.  German Thanksgiving <b>celebrations</b> include religious ceremonies, communal gatherings and, of course, food. The <b>celebrations</b> vary by region but are mostly held in rural areas. Often, there&rsquo;s a parade with beautifully decorated floats and people in traditional clothing, creating the atmosphere of a country fair. </p>        <p><a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/789.html">Stores open thanksgiving monday orangeville</a>. <a href="https://thanksgivings.shop/121.html">Kfc open thanksgiving day 2024</a>.
