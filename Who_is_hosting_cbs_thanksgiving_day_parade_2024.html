        <h2><strong>Who is hosting cbs thanksgiving day parade 2024 Cheap thanksgiving dinner ideas</strong></h2>
        <p>It is believed that America&rsquo;s first Thanksgiving, actually a harvest feast that brought together 53 Pilgrims and some 90 Native Americans, occurred in the fall of 1621. Beginning in 1668, the holiday was celebrated on November <b>25</b>, but that lasted only a few years.  It wasn&rsquo;t until 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day to be held each <b>November</b>. But the holiday is not without controversy.  In 2024, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November <b>28</b>. Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.  Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in <b>October</b> and <b>November</b> in the United States, Canada, Saint Lucia, Liberia, and unofficially in countries like Brazil, Germany and the Philippines. It is also observed in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.  The earliest <b>Thanksgiving</b> can occur is Nov. 22, according to &quot;The Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac.&quot; The latest it can occur is Nov. 28, like it does in 2024. &#39;Day of Publick Thanksgivin&#39; celebrated in 1789  For two years two days were celebrated as <b>Thanksgiving</b> - the President and part of the nation celebrated it on the second to last Thursday in <b>November</b>, while the rest of the country celebrated it the following week. To end the confusion, Congress decided to set a fixed-date for the holiday.  With President Abraham Lincoln&#39;s 1863 proclamation, <b>Thanksgiving</b> became regularly celebrated on the last Thursday in <b>November</b>.  Learn how it has evolved from its religious roots as Spanish and English days of feasting and prayer to become the football-watching, parade-marching, gut-stuffing event it is today. English...  As we get ready to celebrate <b>Thanksgiving</b> on Thursday, <b>November</b> 28, 2024, it might seem like a well-established rule that <b>Thanksgiving</b> falls on the fourth Thursday of <b>November</b>. But did you know that this hasn&rsquo;t <b>always</b> been the case? In the past, <b>Thanksgiving</b> has been celebrated on different Thursdays in <b>November</b>, and in the early ... </p>        <p>Best disney thanksgiving movies.
