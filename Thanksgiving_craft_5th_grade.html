        <p><b>On</b> <b>September</b> <b>8</b>, <b>1565</b>, Pedro Men&eacute;ndez de Avil&eacute;s and 800 Spanish settlers founded the city of St. Augustine in Spanish La Florida. As soon as they were ashore, the landing party celebrated a Mass of Thanksgiving.  The nation&rsquo;s real first Thanksgiving took place more than <b>50</b> <b>years</b> earlier near the Matanzas River in St. Augustine, <b>Florida</b>, when Spanish explorer Pedro Men&eacute;ndez de Avil&eacute;s and 800 soldiers, sailors and settlers joined local Native Americans in a feast that followed a Mass of Thanksgiving, according to Kathleen Deagan, distinguished ...  Actually, several years, 56 years before the 1621 pilgrim <b>Thanksgiving</b>. And that took place in St. Augustine. And it was on Sept. 8, 1565. And it was led by several different Spanish priests. It was all part of the expedition of Pedro Men&eacute;ndez de Avil&eacute;s.  The <b>first Thanksgiving</b> <b>celebration</b> in North America actually took place <b>in Florida</b>. Fifty-five years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, colonists in St. Augustine shared a feast of <b>thanksgiving</b> with Native Americans.  Numerous thanksgivings for a safe voyage and landing had been made before in Florida, by such explorers as Juan Ponce de Le&oacute;n, in <b>1513</b> <b>and</b> <b>1521</b>, P&aacute;nfilo de Narv&aacute;ez in 1528, Hernando de Soto in 1529, Father Luis C&aacute;ncer de Barbastro in 1549, and Trist&aacute;n de Luna in 1559.  The first Thanksgiving was held <b>in</b> St. Augustine, <b>Florida</b> 56 years prior to the Pilgrims. The meal was between Spanish settlers and the Seloy tribe in 1565.  <b>55</b> <b>years</b> before the Mayflower Pilgrims set foot in Plymouth Colony, Spanish explorers and Native Americans in St. Augustine, Florida, shared a celebratory meal some describe as the &lsquo;real first&rsquo; American Thanksgiving.  <b>Florida</b>&rsquo;s 500 years of history traces the <b>first</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>celebrated</b> in America to St. Augustine. Long before the Pilgrims and Plymouth Rock. What is known today and <b>celebrated</b> as <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a reenactment of a shared harvest feast of the Plymouth colonist and the Wampanoag Indians in the autumn of 1621.  Tradition holds that the first Thanksgiving was celebrated <b>in</b> <b>1621</b>, as English Pilgrims at Plymouth Plantation in Massachusetts shared a bountiful harvest with their Native American neighbors.... </p>        <p><a href="./637.html">Crossfit thanksgiving day wods</a>.
