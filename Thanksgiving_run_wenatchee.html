        <h2><strong>Thanksgiving run wenatchee Happy thanksgiving card messages</strong></h2>
        <p>The first <b>Thanksgiving</b> was a harvest celebration held by the <b>pilgrims</b> of Plymouth colony in the 17th century. Many myths surround the first <b>Thanksgiving</b>. Very little is actually known about the event because only two firsthand accounts of the feast were ever written.  Puritans and <b>Pilgrims</b> came out of the same religious culture of 1570s England. <b>Pilgrims</b> hosted the first American <b>Thanksgiving</b>, and Puritans arrived later.  You&#39;ve probably heard stories about the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> - you know, <b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans coming together for a grand feast. Join us as we review the facts - and do a bit of myth-busting.  The United States holiday of <b>Thanksgiving</b> is generally understood to be inspired by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of Plymouth Colony (later known as <b>pilgrims</b>) and the Native Americans of the Wampanoag Confederacy in the fall of 1621.  Americans are told the first <b>Thanksgiving</b> took place in 1621, when the <b>Pilgrim</b> settlers of Plymouth, Massachusetts, invited the Wampanoag to a harvest feast. The story goes the meal invite was to thank them for their help in planting crops, and that a warm friendship budded between the two people groups.  The Mashpee Wampanoag first encountered the <b>Pilgrims</b> who arrived on the Mayflower ship in 1620. They say much is missing from the often-told <b>Thanksgiving</b> story.  For American culture, the story of the <b>Pilgrims</b>, including their &ldquo;first Thanksgiving&rdquo; feast with the local Native Americans, has become the ruling creation narrative, celebrated each November along with turkey, pumpkin pie, and football games.  <b>Thanksgiving</b> is a great holiday to relax and enjoy the company of loved ones; however, its origins aren&rsquo;t as simple as you might think. While the history of <b>Thanksgiving</b> often follows the same themes&mdash;<b>Pilgrims</b> and Native Americans breaking bread together, giving thanks&mdash;how we celebrate today is a bit more complicated.  Did Florida Host the First <b>Thanksgiving</b>? More than 50 years before the Pilgrims <b>landed</b> in Plymouth, Spanish colonists in Florida feasted with Native Americans in what some call the first... </p>        <p>Home depot hours during thanksgiving.
