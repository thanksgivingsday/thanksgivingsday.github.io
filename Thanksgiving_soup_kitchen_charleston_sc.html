        <p>The quincea&ntilde;era, and the fifteen teens who form part of her celebration, could be asked to participate in a day of retreat or in one or several sessions of preparation with talks, activities and <b>prayer</b>, together with the celebration of the Sacrament of Penance, prior to the date of the celebration.  The one who presides invites the Quincea&ntilde;era (<b>Quincea&ntilde;eras</b>) to make an act of thanksgiving and of personal commitment to lead a Christian life. The Quincea&ntilde;era (Quincea&ntilde;eras) may do so using these or similar words:  As part of the custom, girls are taken with their parents and godparents to a <b>Thanksgiving</b> Mass in which they express gratitude for the gift of life and ask a blessing for the years to come. For the Blessing of the Quincea&ntilde;era at Church these are some of the recommended readings.  During the special quincea&ntilde;era&rsquo;s rituals, the quincea&ntilde;era is invited to make &ldquo;<b>An</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thanks</b>- giving and of Personal Commitment to Lead a Christian Life.&rdquo; The text for this will be provided on a card on the day of the Thanksgiving Mass for quince a&ntilde;os.  Download the full recommendations on our Guidelines, Recommendations, and Policies page or see a few highlighted points of the information below. The quincea&ntilde;era is a traditional celebration of life and gratitude to God on the occasion of the fifteenth birthday of a young Hispanic woman.  Among several Spanish-speaking countries and among many Hispanics in the United States there is the custom of celebrating the passage from childhood to adolescence with a ritual that expresses <b>thanksgiving</b> to God for the gift of life and that asks for a blessing from God for the years ahead.  AN ACT OF THANKSGIVING AND OF PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO LEAD A CHRISTIAN LIFE Quincea&ntilde;era: Heavenly <b>Father</b>, I thank you for the gift of life for creating me in your image and likeness and for calling me to be your daughter through baptism. Thank you for sending your Son Jesus to save me and your Holy Spirit to sanctify me.  #1 Prayer For Quincea&ntilde;era. <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Father</b>, Thank you for (name) and for this time of joy and celebration on her Quincea&ntilde;era. It is such an inspiration to see a young adult willfully choose to follow you. Please surround her with your hand of protection as she steps forward to live the life you have placed before her.  Among several Spanish-speaking countries and among many Hispanics in the United States there is the custom of celebrating the passage from childhood to adolescence with a ritual that expresses <b>thanksgiving</b> to God for the gift of life and that asks for a blessing from God for the years ahead. </p>        <p>When is thanksgiving break for blinn college.
