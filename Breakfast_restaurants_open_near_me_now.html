Encourage the congregation to practice gratitude in action in their daily lives, making their thanksgiving truly transformative.  Give thanks to God in <b>prayer</b> and <b>praise</b>. In our Epistle reading from Philippians, St. Paul says to come to God in prayer &ldquo;with thanksgiving.&rdquo; So today when you gather at the dinner table, say out loud a prayer of thanksgiving, or ask the host to do so.  Here are some common prayer points that can be included in a thanksgiving <b>prayer</b>: <b>Gratitude</b> for <b>God</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> love, grace, and mercy. Thanking God for His provision &ndash; food, shelter, clothing, and other basic needs. Gratitude for good health and healing. Thanking God for family and relationships.  Whether you&rsquo;re celebrating with loved ones or finding a quiet moment alone, these <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>prayers</b> will help you connect with your faith and enrich your holiday. Let&rsquo;s dive into these heartfelt <b>prayers</b> and discover new ways to make this <b>Thanksgiving</b> truly special.  In order for this we must realize what we have. St. Paul emphasizes <b>thanksgiving</b> throughout his writings and uses the phrase in our text, &ldquo;Thanks be to God&rdquo; four times. (1 Cor. 15:57; 2 Cor. 2:14; 8:16; 9:15). All are veritable outbursts of gratitude.  <b>Praise</b> the Lord and count your blessings (vv. 1-2) It is a <b>prayer</b> of nothing but <b>praise</b> to God.

Finding <b>gratitude</b> amidst challenges: - Share stories of individuals who found gratitude in adversity. 2. The connection between prayer, rejoicing, and giving thanks: - Unpack how prayer, rejoicing, and gratitude form a powerful trifecta for a resilient faith.  As our thanksgiving expands, it should include at least these 3 things; <b>1</b>) <b>The</b> <b>Blessings</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b>.
